"Fangko + Coffee And Beer [Sponsored]: 8/10

Indomee holds a special place in my heart. Aside from being the only instant noodles I've ever consumed, indomee was also how my class generated funds for our school festival. I couldn't believe I could relive such nostalgia, especially during a tasting!

Indomie Smash Chimken [Spice Level 5]: 8/10
This is a tasteful way of making instant noodles luxurious. The indomie had the usual sweet umami flavor, with the sambal and minced pork imparting a lingering savory taste to the noodles. The kelopok was perfectly salted, and the crunch went well with the bouncy noodles.

Personally, I enjoyed the spiciness of the indomie as it helped cut through the rich flavors. However, I think ordering above Level 10 would be a huge risk to even the biggest lovers of spice.

Gula Melaka Kopi: 7/10
I love a darker white coffee, and this was just that. The gula melaka provided a slight earthy sweetness without dominating the coffee itself.

Do consider this for brunch if you are ever near Clarke Quay, you won't be disappointed!

Thanks to @fangkocoffee for the tasting :)","https://www.instagram.com/p/C4Lkp_EyrBK/","2024-03-06T17:15:45+0000","18031629346734373"
"Le Shrimp Ramen [Star Vista]: 7.5/10

Soup-based meals are a blessing in our recent nonstop rainy weather. However, one can only eat ban mian and fish soup for so long. This place would be a good way to change up your routine!

Ebiko Prawn Paste  Shrimp Ramen [$16.30]: 7.5/10
The broth was hearty, and the sweetness of the sea permeated each sip. The springy noodles complements the broth perfectly, creating a delicious combination of texture and taste. The juicy and flavorful prawn paste was the icing on the cake. The only drawback of the whole meal was that there wasn't more.

Le Shrimp Ramen is an amazing meal in our gloomy weather, and I implore you to try it if you are ever nearby! Take note that the line for this place gets ridiculously long during peak hours (~15-20 minutes), so come early to get your soul food fix!","https://www.instagram.com/p/C1AOjLTyOHu/","2023-12-18T17:56:30+0000","17959880855693776"
"One Fattened Calf: 8.5/10

This gave Wildfire Burgers a good run for its money, which wasn't something I was expecting to say in 2023.

OFC Cheeseburger ($15.00 + $4.90 set): 8.5/10

This cheeseburger was as good as the one served at Wildfire Burgers. The sweetness of the potato bun complemented the savoriness of the beef, and the tangy sauce helped keep the burger from being too heavy on the palate.
The only problem I personally had was how soggy the bun was. I couldn't overlook the yucky soft texture every time I bit into it. Even though the taste beats Wildfire in both intensity and balance, Wildfire will still be my go-to for a good burger.

I would highly recommend everyone to try both this and Wildfire, and let me know which one you would prefer in the comments below!

"Fat Cow: 9.5/10

People would not stop raving about this wagyu omakase at Orchard, claiming it to be a culinary experience that should not be missed. Naturally, I had high expectations for the meal.

My expectations were not only met, but far exceeded.

Wagyu Omakase ($290.00) {+$68 for sake pairing} : 9.5/10
No single dish was lacking. From the zensai platter to the wagyu chazuke, each was an absolute treat. In particular, the spring rolls, sukiyaki and yakiniku were the highlight of the evening.

Wagyu Fresh Spring Rolls: 9.3/10
Each spring roll was paired with a different sauce, resulting in what felt like a mini omakase. The egg yolk and cheese roll were delicate and complex in flavours and textures, exactly as an appetiser should be. The sesame and shiso leaf sauce bombarded my taste buds with umami goodness, as though it was a main course. The salted plum sweetness and acidity helped cut through the richness and cleanse the palate, precisely like how a good dessert should be. I appreciated how well-designed the dish was, and it made me more eager for the rest of the night!

Wagyu Sukiyaki & Japanese Beinasu: 9.4/10
This was my most anticipated dish of the night, and it certainly delivered! The sweetness and savoury taste of the beef lingers in your mouth, and makes you crave for more. I thought I couldn't be happier.

I was wrong.

Charcoal-grilled Yakiniku-Style Wagyu with Burdock Sauce: 9.6/10
This was the best beef dish I've ever had in my life.
The yakiniku was charred flawlessly, and the rich smoky savory taste was unmatched by anything I've ever had. The maitake mushrooms added an intense earthiness that complemented the robust umami-ness of the beef. The sweet potato elevated the meal with its decadence and intense sweetness. If I had died right there and then, I would have no complaints.

Artisanal Ice Cream ($8) [Matcha]: 9.3/10
I couldn't ask for a better dessert to end the meal. The intense earthy sweetness of matcha is superbly complemented by the airy texture of the ice cream. If matcha isn't for you, the goma and yuzu variants are just as good, if not better.

This is the best meal I've ever had in Singapore. Need I say more?","https://www.instagram.com/p/CxidzjVPs32/","2023-09-23T14:58:24+0000","18260416333164315"
"Bonding Kitchen: 8.5/10

As a lover of Peranakan cuisine, I've always had a penchant for rendang. However, the repeated disappointment from visiting subpar Peranakan restaurants has made me wary of such establishments.
In fact, I probably wouldn't have tried this place if Supply and Demand didn't have a queue that resembled the line for Taylor Swift tickets.

Ngoh Hiang ($20): 8/10
I think this was one of the best Ngoh Hiang I’ve ever had. The skin was perfectly crisp, and the meat was tender and juicy. The delightful balance of sweetness and savoriness, combined with the earthiness of mushrooms, made it an irresistible starter that left me craving for more.

Wagyu Beef Rendang ($37.50): 8/10
The restaurant claims this dish to have ""an insane amount of flavour,"" and I am ashamed for doubting that statement.
Personally, I prefer chicken to beef rendang due to the usual blandness of the latter. However, this was one of the few exceptions. Using wagyu beef helped add even more sweetness to the already rich umami gravy, and made each bite feel truly sinful. If this ever became the reason for my clogged arteries, I would not regret it a single bit.

Sambal Petai with Ikan Bilis ($20) : 8.8/10
The sambal and ikan bilis were as good as the ones found in Malaysian nasi lemak, and that's the biggest compliment I can give.
I hate the taste of petai, but I would order this again in a heartbeat.

I know this place is on the pricier side, but if you like Peranakan food, the bill will be the last thing on your mind.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CvfOhnuPquD/","2023-08-03T15:44:22+0000","17985733220199141"
"Brother's Ramen: 7/10

As someone with high expectations of ramen, this is one of the few places where those expectations can be met. 

Brother's Ramen ($15.90): 7/10
This was the first good bowl of ramen I've had in a while. The broth was extremely rich in umami flavour without being overly salty, and each sip made you want more. The noodles are bouncy and absorb the broth well, and the crunchiness of the bamboo shoots legitimately made me wish I had ordered more.
However, there were a couple of nitpicks I had with the dish. The onsen egg was slightly overcooked, and the chashu could afford to be far more flavourful. 

Overall, it's one of the better bowls of ramen in Singapore. If you find Torasho's fusion dishes not to your liking, this place would be perfect for you!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CuzfDq9v1Es/","2023-07-17T16:02:15+0000","18014643952725122"
"Gotti: 8.8/10

I was ORDERED to review this restaurant after one of my close friends had their birthday celebration here. They couldn't stop raving about how great their food was. Hell, they even scheduled messages periodically to remind me of my obligation.

I'm grateful I have such friends. 

Set Menu [$118]: 9/10

Amuse Bouche: 9.5/10
These are the best scallops I've ever had. The acidic yuzu sauce pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the scallops, which just melt in your mouth. The only problem is that I couldn't have more.

Fegato D’Anatra: 8/10
The sweetness of the pear, onions and beetroot dampens the rich earthiness of the liver. Some might find it disappointing, but I enjoyed this balanced take on what is a normally decadent dish.

Risotto Al Gamberi: 9/10
My friend, who recently went to Europe, didn't like this dish as it was undercooked and lacked seasoning.
However, as someone who never had risotto, this was amazing. I loved the firmer texture of the rice. I loved the sweetness and savoriness of the lobster bisque. I loved how spice was used to help cut through the rich risotto. I loved this dish.

Dentice: 7/10
The salsa provides acidity and pepperiness, which pairs well with the velvety umami sauce. While it's decent, the main star was the sauce instead of the fish, which is different from how I personally enjoy fish dishes.

Filetto Di Manzo: 7/10
This was a decent tenderloin. My nitpick is that the tenderloin should be better seasoned, as it tasted bland solo.

Tiramisu: 7/10
Even though the tiramisu had far too much cream for my liking, it was still well-balanced due to the liberal use of coffee. A more alcoholic approach would have made it even better.

Signor Gotti ($36): 8.5/10
This is the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is unbelievably crispy, with that distinctive smoky charred taste. It has a perfect cheese pull, and the mild saltiness adds to the flavour. The only flaw is that the beef cheeks taste slightly stale on their own, but the dish as a whole is fantastic.

The service is exquisite, the ambience is terrific, and the food is sublime. Gotti is an experience you can’t refuse.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CuEsWlGvObQ/","2023-06-29T11:54:07+0000","18030918826523496"
"GelatiAmo OneNorth: 8/10
I recently had the pleasure of visiting this gelato outlet, and it was a delightful experience.

Single Cup + Waffle ($12.50): 8/10
While I must confess that I am not usually a big fan of waffles – no thanks to their tendency to both appear and taste like soggy dough – GelatiAmo is a most delectable exception. Their waffles are incredibly crisp, and they paired beautifully with the decadent dark chocolate gelato I ordered.

To all waffle haters, I highly recommend visiting GelatiAmo OneNorth and giving their waffle-gelato combination a chance. Just one bite and it may very well change your mind <3","https://www.instagram.com/p/CpiJvw_vhC5/","2023-03-08T15:51:58+0000","17977557941019884"
"Sugarhall: 8/10

This is the first bar I've ever been to in my 23 years of living. I couldn't ask for better for my first time.

Daiquiri ($22): 7.5/10
I'm not a fan of rum as it's too sweet for my taste. (I prefer whiskey/gin)

Despite that, I thoroughly enjoyed this drink. The sweetness was balanced nicely with the alcohol's fiery burn. After spin class, this was just the drink I needed to wind down my day.

I also want to give a big shoutout to CJ, my bartender for the night. He was great company, and it was a pleasure talking with him at the bar. 

If you enjoy rum, I highly recommend Sugarhall. The ambience and bartenders are both fantastic, and you wouldn't regret your visit!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CoXU7tvPRmD/","2023-02-07T14:26:41+0000","18173090077267449"
"OOTB: 8/10

I can't believe that I've found not one, but TWO of the best burger places in 2022!

Classic Cheese ($13.90): 8/10
The meat is very tender and juicy, and I would consider it even better in texture than the burgers at Wildfire. It's also extremely savoury, and the cheese adds a richness that makes the whole burger decadent.

Personally, I prefer Wildfire as it's more balanced in terms of texture and flavour, but this is easily a close second. The service here is excellent, and I had a fun time talking to the staff while enjoying my lunch :)","https://www.instagram.com/p/CmqwFCTSq0v/","2022-12-27T10:26:40+0000","18025870654445491"
"Dumpling Darlings [Amoy Street]: 7/10

Recently, I caved into the popularity of spin classes because of my lack of physical endurance, but while I was usually dead tired at the end, there's one particular place where the food more than reinvigorates me for the rest of my day.

Lunch Deal [Braised Pork Noodles/The Original] ($17): 7/10

The noodles are pretty mediocre. The noodles weren't springy enough while the braised pork meat was just slightly too tough for my liking. The only redeeming factor of the dish was the flavorful soy tare, as the acidity and savoriness it brought helped lift what would be an otherwise middling entree. 

However, it's called ""Dumpling Darlings"" for a reason, and the dumplings did not disappoint.

The dumplings' skin was incredibly crispy and just thin enough that I didn't feel like I was just eating seasoned flour. The acidity of the dumplings balanced out the umami richness of the pork collar and the oily crust perfectly. With the dumplings being so well-made, it's no surprise that this was one of the better dumplings I've had in a long time.

It's a decent and affordable eatery in the city, and that's good enough for me!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CkG5sCrBmeu/","2022-10-24T19:15:11+0000","18216421210165973"

I got the chance to attend @potsandpans Dim Sum Making Workshop, and it was an eye-opening experience! As I was a person with no cooking experience, I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to catch up. However, my worries were unfounded. Chef Andrew is an excellent teacher, and even a newbie like me could make a halfway decent egg tart and siew mai under his guidance :)

These classes are also SkillsFuture credit approved, making it ever more easy to brush up your culinary skills!

"Wildfire Burgers [Keppel]: 9/10 

If you believe that this rating for a burger restaurant is especially high, know that my friends would have given it an even higher score.

Classic 001 Cheeseburger [Double] ($16): 9/10 

It's criminal that a burger can be so good for this price. 
The patty is perfect. 
The texture is sublime. It's extremely juicy without being overly greasy. Its seasoning is even more exquisite. The angus beef packs an intense umami taste, which is perfectly complemented by the sweetness of the caramelized onions and house sauce. You won't be able to find burgers that are even half as savory and sweet. 

This place serves the best burgers in Singapore. Need I say more?

P.S. I'd heartily recommend The Citrus Crusher to anyone looking to relax after a hard day.

P.PS: Shoutout to the waitress. Not only did she give excellent recommendations, but she also roasted my friends into oblivion.","https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci8LSi3P4SX/","2022-09-25T18:45:57+0000","17963673997929516"
"Happy Chef Western Food: 7.5/10

This eatery is directly behind the famed Tai Hwa Pork Noodle stall and I would highly recommend it if you don't want to wait in line for 30+ minutes

Chicken Schnitzel ($7.50): 7.5/10
For the price, the dish is quite generous. The dish is, in my opinion, just as filling as dishes comparable to those served at Astons/Hot Tomato.
That's not to say that this dish is all quantity without quality. The chicken skin is extremely crispy, and the meat itself is very tender and juicy. In addition, I've been to more expensive places with worse potato salad and coleslaw.
But everything isn't perfect. There's far too much chicken skin, and the chicken meat requires more seasoning.

This is the best place under $10 to satisfy your Western food cravings.

P.S: The tagged location is Block 466 but I think it hasn't been updated to the new location of Block 465.","https://www.instagram.com/p/ChC0qo8PI0P/","2022-08-09T15:40:10+0000","18253107169096621"
"Ah Er Herbal Soup: 7.5/10

I was always afraid to try herbal soups that weren't homemade. They are usually bland, overly salted, or a mixture of both. Naturally, I haven't had herbal soups in a long time. Knowing these circumstances, could you even blame me for being wary of the soup?

Those fears were baseless in hindsight.

Ten Tonic Ginseng Chicken Soup ($5.50): 7.5/10

I was reminded of my grandmother's herbal chicken soup, and that's the best compliment I can give. The earthy bitterness of the herbs was fully incorporated into the broth, and every sip made me want more.
Though the soup was far above average, I still had some nitpicks. The chicken was a bit too dry and stringy, and its rough texture made it very unappetizing. The bitterness of the soup was also dampened due to the broth being overly sweet.

However, even after all of these nitpicks, I would still heartily recommend the soups sold here. It's one of the rare shops in the West that sells good-quality soup, and the warmth it brings on a rainy day is truly nourishing for the soul.

P.S: Soup dishes always remind me of my childhood, and I'm also thus reminded of the people that aren't here anymore. Appreciate your loved ones, as Father Time always wins.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CgMojhjPyZi/","2022-07-19T14:35:21+0000","18012420952425747"
"Poon Nah City Home Made Noodle: 8/10

If you are in Paya Lebar and are in need of a fix when it's raining, this is just the place for you.

Sliced Fish Homemade Ban Mee ($4.50): 8/10

This is the quintessential ban mian. 
The soup is flavourful and refreshing, albeit slightly on the saltier side. The mee hoon kuey itself is just the right thickness. It's chewy without making me feel like I'm eating dough. The anchovies were fried a beautiful golden brown, and its crispiness provided much needed crunch to the noodles. 
The highlight of the meal was definitely the chilli. The chilli was extremely spicy and fragrant. This, along with its slight earthiness, added depth of flavour when paired with the various components in the broth.

The East is always better than the West in food, and this is no exception to that rule.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CfzJpwkvqcI/","2022-07-09T17:04:18+0000","17959130929847255"
"Cherry Garden: 9/10

I have gotten a craving for dim sum recently. Even though I already know of places that satisfy this craving, I wanted to try something new. Cherry Garden's popularity, as well as its extensive dim sum menu, piqued my interest.

Dim Sum Brunch ($78): 9/10
As a whole, this was a fantastic experience. Most of the dim sum were of at least decent quality, and I could tell that the dishes were freshly made and not just leftovers. 

There were many notable dishes that I would highly recommend.

The duck meat and char siew appetizer are excellent. They are both very flavourful and tender. This is coming from a person who loathes duck meat, which speaks to how well made this appetizer is.
The bean curd skin roll is amazing too. It's by far the best deep-fried dish I've had. The batter is seasoned beautifully and is extremely crispy. The batter is also not too thick, which allows you to enjoy the juiciness and sweetness of the prawn filling. 

The best dishes of the meal were the char siew bao and the siew mai.
The char siew bao is rich in sweetness and savoriness, which is not unusual given that the bao uses Kurobuta pork as its filling. 
However, what impressed me more was the siew mai. The siew mai is extremely juicy, and each bite results in an explosion of savoury sweetness that leaves you wanting more. This is the best siew mai I have ever eaten, and I would rate the siew mai a 9.5/10 easily.

If I only ate the few dishes above, Cherry Garden would easily be a 9.4/9.5. However, there were a few dishes that were a let down.

The prawn dumpling (har gow) wasn't as juicy as Li Bai's. The xiao long bao is very underwhelming, especially since it was unexpectedly sweet instead of salty. The pork belly, while extremely crispy, was very bland.

If one doesn't mind the price, Cherry Garden is a perfect place to enjoy high-quality dimsum and other Cantonese dishes. The service is excellent, and their tea is great as well. I would highly recommend booking at least 5 days in advance as the place is usually full for walk-ins. 

P.S: It took me 30 minutes to even find Mandarin Oriental, so do give yourself time for a walk as there is a 1.5 hour limit!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CejRvZEvy-_/","2022-06-08T16:35:44+0000","17938401938164035"
"Bijin Nabe [Thomson Plaza]: 8/10

If you want flavour in a hotpot, this would be the best place to get it.

Set ($25 per pax): 8/10

This is one of the best value-meals for a hotpot. You only need to pay a bit more compared to budget hotpots like Seoul Garden for a huge increase in quality.

The soup base is made out of melted collagen. As one would expect, this gives the soup an extreme umami flavour. This not only pairs well with the bland vegetables, but also intensifies any shabu meat you choose to order. On this point, I would highly recommend ordering their beef ($25) as the marbling is wonderful. 

Nikumaki Onigiri ($4): 7/10

The meat isn’t dried out and the rice is well-seasoned, but it wasn’t as flavourful as I remembered it to be. Still, I would recommend that you order this once to see whether this is to your liking :)

Overall, if you want a good hotpot for your buck, this would be my recommendation. The service is excellent (the servers help you prepare the food and the portions), and there are many outlets, so you can easily find one near you to try!","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdi0H1xPZ2W/","2022-05-14T15:45:32+0000","17946442156940693"
"Pietrasanta The Italian Restaurant: 9/10

I started April with a huge L at @mitsuba.j.restaurant . I end April with a huge W with this restaurant.

Sautè Di Vongole ($26.90): 8.6/10

The freshness of the clams is extraordinary. I particularly liked that such fresh clams were paired with a lot of garlic since the pungent taste helped liven the dish. The only other restaurant that provides a clam dish of similar quality is @greenwoodfishmarket. That restaurant was my favourite in 2021, which just goes to show how good this dish was.

Piestrasanta [Top Half] + Prosciutto E Funghi [Bottom Half] ($26.90): 8.7/10

This pizza combination came as a recommendation from the server. 

I have to commend that server's excellent taste.

On their own, both pizzas were what I expected of gourmet pizzas; an extemely stringy pizza that's seasoned to perfection.
However, the magic happens when they are paired together. The intense savoriness from the beef in the Piestranta complements the earthiness of the mushrooms in the E Funghi. Every slice of pizza from one half made me crave the other. Soon enough, there was nothing left.

Tagliatelle Gamberi ($28.90): 9/10

This is the best pasta I've ever had.
The juiciness of the prawns is unrivalled. The garlic, basil and pepper helps keep their sweetness from overwhelming the pasta. When these flavours are complemented with the perfectly al dente pasta, every bite was exquisite. I couldn't help but smile after each mouthful.

Crème Brûlée ($15.90): 8.5/10

The tapping of the caramelised sugar is heaven to my ears. The crispiness of the burnt sugar, along with the velvety texture of the custard, makes this one of the best crème brûlée in Singapore. It's also just the right amount of sweetness for me, which is impressive as I usually find most crème brûlée saccharine. 

Tiramisu ($17.90): 9/10

This tiramisu is the embodiment of balance. The sweetness of the cream is tempered by the bitterness of the coffee and rum. The dense cream is elevated by the airiness of the sponge cake. No single flavor or texture overpowers the entire dessert, and I only wished I had more.

Overall, this is my favourite restaurant in the West. Need I say more?","https://www.instagram.com/p/CdC7kGyvQjC/","2022-05-02T06:34:52+0000","17941673587988230"
"Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun [Blk 429 Jurong West Ave 1]: 8/10

Chee Cheong Fun is a homely dish that is ingrained in many people’s childhoods, of lively family chatter and mornings spent around a hawker center table, a few steps away from the bask of a sweltering sun. 

Personally, I prefer the Hong Kong version due to my fondness for umami flavour. This makes it doubly hard to find a Chee Cheong Fun to my liking, and I was delighted that I could find something so good near where I live!

Prawn Chee Cheong Fun ($5): 8/10
I am blessed that the franchise opened an outlet near me. 
The skin is thin and silky, resulting in a smooth mouthfeel. This texture pairs flawlessly with the firm prawns, and makes each bite all the more enjoyable. The prawns also provide a sweetness that complements the savoriness of the soy sauce. The combination of these textures and flavours results in a dish so good that you wish you had more.

Overall, please do give this a try if you have never tried Hong Kong Chee Cheong Fun before. Trust me, you won’t be disappointed.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CbaFCL6Pwdi/","2022-03-22T13:17:21+0000","17938253638962358"
"Chuan Kee Boneless Braised Duck [#01-04 @Ghim Moh Market] : 7.5/10

I really dislike ducks. Those beady-eyed waterbirds are the spawn of Satan, and their meat fully exemplifies their hideous nature. The smell is unbearable and the taste is way too gamey for my liking. However, my friends could not stop urging me to try this Bib-Gourmand stall in Ghim Moh market, and I'm glad I went.

Duck Rice Set ($4.50): 7.5/10

At first, I couldn't register that this was duck meat. It wasn't as gamey as other duck meats I’ve tried before. Instead, the meat was tender and moist. 
The sauce paired artfully with the well-prepared meat. It added a much-needed savoriness and sweetness that complemented the texture of the duck.
The soup was a pleasant surprise. Most would expect such soups to be just a forgettable side dish, but happily, this was not the case. The broth was deep and robust in herbal flavour and its earthiness was a good contrast to the richness of the duck.
The chilli was my favourite part of the dish. Compared to other chillis, it was notably more acidic. This helped cut through the richness of the gravy and kept the sauce from being too overwhelming.
My only issue was that the food was inconsistent. My friend had the same dish as me, but his chilli was considerably more rancid. 

Overall, I’d say this is the best duck rice for duck haters. The portions are pretty generous for their price, so it's pretty good for value too!","https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca2PLSzPvVn/","2022-03-08T15:13:19+0000","17955979111647419"

This is my second collaboration with @fragrance_bak_kwa , and this time, they sent me some truffle bak kwa to try. I had previously enjoyed the kampong chicken they sent me and I hoped that the bak kwa would be just as good, if not better.

Premium Truffle Bak Kwa [150g] ($12): 7.5/10
The problem I have with most bak kwa is that each successive bite becomes increasingly difficult to eat, due to its rich flavor.
Adding truffles is a great way to solve this problem. Its pungent aroma and earthiness contrast sharply with the sweet taste and smell of the snack, grounding the meal and making each bite consistently delightful.

Please check out Part 1 of the review if you have not done so!

Whole Lou De Mer ($79): 9/10
A dish is truly unique when it causes my mother to scrape every bit of meat from the bone.
The sea bass is incredibly fresh. It readily falls off the bone, and the meat melts on your tongue. On this alone, it already outperforms most of the competition.
The sauce, however, is what takes it to another level. 
Each bite was that much more intense due to the added umami and sweetness of the sauce. Its richness further added to the dish's decadence, tempered by a gentle acidity.
The potato was also a pleasant surprise. It was seasoned with salt and pepper, and its creaminess is nothing to scoff at. A marvellous side to a marvellous main.

NZ Littleneck Clams ($26.95): 8.7/10
These clams were diligently shucked; there was not a single piece of grit nor grain of sand in any of them. When paired with the garlicky white wine reduction, each mollusc was an explosion of flavour chased by a sweet finish, leaving you wanting more.

I couldn't imagine that, aside from omakase restaurants, seafood could be done so beautifully in Singapore. The ambience is charming, the food is amazing, and the service is terrific. What's not to love?","https://www.instagram.com/p/CYJh0Arvhm9/","2021-12-31T13:27:33+0000","17907457904352060"
"Greenwood Fish Market [Bukit Timah] (Part 1): 9.1/10

My mother's love of steak is well known among her friends and relatives, so she was quite surprised when her friend took us to a seafood restaurant for her birthday. But after such a splendid meal, I can't believe we ever doubted her friend's recommendation.

Grilled Seafood Salad ($21.95): 8.5/10
This mixed green shares the same qualities as other well-made salads - fresh and crisp vegetables paired nicely with a balanced lemon vinaigrette.
However, what makes this salad different is the excellent preparation of the seafood.
The squid is superb: juicy, tender, firm. The prawns are similarly immaculate. Rarely will you find crustaceans as delicious as those served here. 
With the starter so brilliantly executed, I couldn't help but be excited for the rest of the dinner!

Seafood Margherita Pizza ($49.95): 8.8/10
I must admit I was disappointed when the pizza came with a thick crust. Thick crust pizzas often feel overly starchy and bland, and the chewiness makes each slice tedious to eat.
However, this Margherita was unlike those mediocre pizzas.
The crust was just the ideal thickness, fluffy enough to offer texture while thin enough such that each mouthful wasn't simply dough. Meanwhile, the mozzarella imparted a distinct stringiness to the dish, creating the perfect Margherita pizza when mixed with the sweet and sour tomato sauce. The seafood was just the cherry on top.
To demonstrate how good the pizza was, we took the slices we couldn't finish home and gave it to my friends.
They ate it cold and still thought it was delicious.

"Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew Cuisine (Part 2): 9/10

This review is a continuation of Part 1!

Braised Sea Cucumber with Goose Web: 8.5/10

Usually, I wouldn't say I like sea cucumber. It's rubbery, bland and ridiculously pricey. However, I'm now convinced I've simply never had good sea cucumber before.
The sea cucumber is firm rather than gelatinous. When combined with the savoury oyster sauce, this creates an umami goodness that leaves you wanting more.
The goose web is also no slouch. The flesh simply slips off the bone, and its soft and juicy texture complements the oyster sauce well.

Braised Thick Noodles with Crab Meat & Italian Truffle Oil: 8.6/10

This meal reminds me of @lollasg's hand-torn pasta. Every element could be tasted in each mouthful: the slightly chewy noodles coated in a savoury sauce; the firm and sweet crab meat; an underlying aroma of truffle oil. Perfection. The many flavours and textures of each component mix to produce a complex taste, and I couldn't help but be amazed by each bite.

I expected the cod to be the best dish of the night, but I had no idea how blown away I would be by the last course.

Sweet Yam Paste: 9.2/10

I won't lie; I have an extreme bias for this dish. Because this dessert and Tiramisu are my favourite ways to conclude any meal, I had high hopes for the orh nee.

I knew I was in for a treat when I held the spoon upside down and the yam paste adhered to it. The flavour isn't saccharine or milky like in many other places. Instead, the intense aroma and taste of yam is the predominant flavour. I ate this dessert slowly, trying to savour it as much as possible before it ran out, and that's high praise coming from a person who eats ice cream at breakneck speed.

The foods are all really strong in flavour, so this might not be the place for you if you can't tolerate intense flavours. Nonetheless, I encourage that you give it a shot. The place's ambience is perfect for special occasions with your friends and loved ones. After all, Christmas IS just tomorrow :)","https://www.instagram.com/p/CX2hvNmvC5A/","2021-12-24T04:21:20+0000","17935281565742267"
"Imperial Treasure Fine Teochew Cuisine (Part 1): 9/10

This elegant Chinese restaurant is located on the upper floors of ION Orchard and has received a Michelin star since 2017. Because I had such a good day at Li Bai, I had high hopes for another fine-dining establishment.
Unlike Wooloomooloo, however, this one not only met but far exceeded my expectations.

Special Set ($98): 9/10

Poached ""Live"" Prawn with Chinese Cabbage in Teochew Style: 8.5/10

The delicate and savory flavor of the minced pork complements the juiciness and sweetness of the prawns well. When combined with the robust broth, this resulted in an incredibly flavorful yet balanced entrée that I enjoyed immensely.

Steamed Cod Fish Fillet with Salted Vegetables & Pork Lard: 8.7/10

I felt dubious about combining cod with pork lard. Cod is an oily fish in and of itself, so pairing it with more fat seemed like a recipe for disaster.
However, I couldn't be more wrong. Instead of overpowering the cod, the pork lard gave a savoury crunch to offset the buttery sweetness of the fish. Furthermore, the acidity of the salted vegetables brought balance to the dish, preventing the dish from being overly rich and exhausting to eat.

Marinated Combination in Teochew Style (Goose Meat & Foie Gras): 7/10

I was pleasantly pleased by how much I enjoyed the goose meat. It's less strong and gamey than duck, and its softer flavour allows the silky rich foie gras to shine even more. The gritty taste of the goose meat also ensured that the foie gras did not overpower the palate, which made me savour the foie gras even more.

While the goose flesh and foie gras were excellent, I found the dish a little monotonous compared to the other courses, so I rated it lower.

"Fragrance [𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐄𝐃]: 8.2/10
I'll have to admit - before they reached out, I didn't know that they sold products other than Bak Kwa! However, their kampong chicken was 𝐌𝐔𝐂𝐇 better than I anticipated.

Salted Kampong Chicken ($16.80): 8.2/10
Before going into the review proper, some context is required. Over the past 2 months, my mum has been cooking kampong chicken on and off for our weekly family dinner. Therefore, the taste of home-cooked kampong chicken was fresh in our minds. Granted, my mum is not the world's best home cook, but she is no slouch either. And for those who are privy to my family, you would know that my mom and I can be quite critical about our food.

However, after sampling the chicken, my mum and I reached a quick agreement. This was 𝐅𝐀𝐑 better than our home-prepared versions.

If you enjoy eating chicken skin, you are in luck. The rich umami and fatty flavour of the chicken skin will leave you satisfied to no end!
Meanwhile, the savoury chicken meat was firm without being rubbery or briny. And when paired with Hainanese chilli, the garlic and spice complement the intensely flavourful chicken to result in a saporous yet balanced bite.

The only minor issue I have is that you can still taste the dish's saltiness after eating it for some time. However, as any sane person would pair this dish with rice, this drawback is not too noticeable.

Overall, I would highly recommend this product if you want good kampong chicken at home. Not only is the taste superior to our homemade versions, but it's also a breeze to prepare in comparison. 

Thank you, @fragrance_bak_kwa , for sending over the food!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CW3NeGQPaYv/","2021-11-29T14:12:04+0000","18205146076136131"
"526 BBQ Seafood: 8.1/10
As I have eaten at more places, I realized that most of the food I had nostalgia for was average. This is NOT one of them.

This dish is also why I find every other BBQ stingray underwhelming.

Stingray ($12): 8.1/10
The stingray isn't just bland like many others. There's an inherent sweetness to the stingray, accompanied by a wok hei that shows the chef's technique. 
The sambal is also near perfect. It brings just the right amount of spice and acidity to the stingray, rounding out the dish's taste and making you want every bite. The only issue with the sambal is that it's particularly oily, so I recommend that others follow what I did; ask them to cook it without the sambal and have the sambal as a condiment instead.

Overall, if you haven't had the joys of eating stingrays, this place is perfect for enlightening you to the wonderful taste of this fish. I recommend that you come early, though (~6-7 pm), as seats become non-existent extremely quickly. Also, if you like quiet eating experiences, pass on this. The place is deafening due to the many locals drinking beer and having hearty conversations.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CWWMNgFvhlx/","2021-11-16T18:26:08+0000","17913615071140441"
"Ghee Huat [#01-111@Boon Lay Place Food Village]: 7.6/10
Due to my terrible impressions of Power Nasi Lemak at Boon Lay, I never thought of frequenting this place until recently. My mother had been craving fried oysters for a while, and this was her go-to to satisfy that want!

Fried Oyster ($5): 7.6/10
The egg is cooked the way I love: Slightly crisp on the outside while extremely fluffy on the inside. 

The oysters themselves tasted like what you would expect: a sweet and salty burst of flavour. Apart from the decent execution of the main ingredients, what sets this place apart is the chilli. The chilli has the right amount of acidity and heat that helps to complement the oysters’ intense sweetness and saltiness, which helps round out the dish and keeps the dish light on the palate.

Overall, if you want good fried oysters in the West, you should try this place out! I must disclose that a family relative of mine oversees the food stall. However, everyone who knows me personally also understands that I am impartial in my judgement of food, so I hope that you guys take the review at face value!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CWGcZzFPhoM/","2021-11-10T15:39:46+0000","17924844229900069"
"Yong Kee Famous Fish ball Noodle [#01-121 @ABC Brickworks Market]: 8.3/10

As usual, Google Reviews aren’t accurate. The fact that this stall is 2.9 stars is a crime, and I hope this review can express how tasty this was and remedy this wrong.

Fishball Noodles [Dry] ($4): 8.3/10
These homemade fishballs will raise your expectations of fishballs in the future. Not only are the fishballs of the perfect saltiness and savoriness, but their texture is also heavenly. You can bite clean through the fishball with surprising ease, resulting in less tension while eating for a much more relaxed experience. 

The sauce is nothing to scoff at either. I particularly enjoyed the substantial heat that the chilli provided, and that, along with the sambal, added depth to the sauce. When paired with the vinegar base, this creates a well-balanced and tantalizing sauce that pairs flawlessly with the springy noodles.

This is one of the best fishball noodles I have eaten in Singapore. I would highly recommend this to anyone living in the west. If you want affordable yet mouth-watering food, this stall fits those criteria immaculately.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CU-Oim-hIWF/","2021-10-13T14:33:19+0000","17898429581228761"
"Li Bai: 8.5/10

When my friend asked which Chinese restaurant we should visit, Li Bai was my answer. You know the food was good when you didn't check for the quality of the photos!

Business Set Lunch ($68) : 8.5/100
Kurobuta Pork | Stir-fried Rice Vermicelli: 8.2/10
As someone who loathes bland vermicelli, this was packed full of peppery flavor. It paired well with the savoriness of the kurobuta pork for a very filling and tantalizing main dish.

Braised South Africa Abalone | Braised Beancurd: 8.3/10
The beancurd is textbook perfection; silky smooth inside and lightly crisp outside. More crucially, the beancurd's lack of flavor helped the abalone's freshness and the sauce's acidity shine.

Li Bai Dim Sum Selection: 8.3/10
[Left: Fried Beancurd Skin, Middle: Black Truffle Dumplings, Right: Foie Gras Dumplings]
The beancurd skin is firm and juicy, and the prawns are incredibly fresh. The exotic ingredients add a layer of complexity behind unfamiliar flavors and textures common to dim sum, exciting the palate in unexpected ways.
Har Gow ($6): 8.5/10
A classic rendition of a staple in our dim sum courses. The har gow's crystal skin breaks apart when you bite into it, releasing savoury juices reminiscent of xiao long bao without overpowering the sweetness of fresh shrimp. 

Pumpkin Thick Soup | Boston Lobster: 8/10
The lobster and pumpkin complement each other well, and the soup remains light even with these heavy flavors. Unfortunately, it felt underwhelming compared to my previous visit, which showed me just how high the bar could be. 

Herbal Jelly: 8.8/10
If you think herbal jelly is just sweet black agar-agar (especially for NS), I pity you. It's called herbal jelly, and Li Bai's version oozes herbal flavor. While Li Bai allows you to add the honey yourself, I recommend trying it without adding any to experience a sublime earthiness. This bitter-sweet dessert is the best way to end the lunch, especially after the richness of the vermicelli.

I highly recommend this place to those that want affordable luxury Chinese food. However, the atmosphere is more suited for a group of friends/family than a private 1-1 meal, so consider that before booking!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CUxGM24BEs1/","2021-10-08T12:10:19+0000","18179214907151833"
"Magosaburo: 8/10

This is the third restaurant I have reviewed at Takashimaya, and it's my favorite.

Mago Lunch Set ($68): 8/10

Healthy Green Salad: 6/10
The overly salted and sour salad put me off more than the appeal of it being ""healthy"".

Signature Chawanmushi: 9/10
This is by far the best chawanmushi I have ever eaten. The texture is glisteningly smooth, and the dashi used gives it just the right amount of umami.

Signature Minced Wagyu Curry Rice: 6.5/10
The rice is not up to par. It's too wet and too sticky, which makes the curry combination very greasy.

Japanese Clam Soup with Spinach: 7.5/10
This is decent clam soup. Instead of tasting the fishiness and sand in most other clam soups, you can taste the sweetness of the clams without it being too overpowering for the palate.

BBQ: 6 (Shoulder Core), 6.5 (Vegetables), 7.5 (King Prawn), 8 (Ribeye Core)
If you prefer the fatty flavor and grease in BBQ, you will enjoy the shoulder core more. Personally, I liked the beefiness that ribeye provides more, so it's the choice of meat I would recommend.
I felt that the mushrooms were quite watery, and the earthy flavor could be further intensified.
The salt is an excellent condiment to pair with the flavors of the different ingredients in the BBQ, but I felt that the salt was too intense to pair with the other components well.

Homemade Tiramisu (with Rum and Kahlua): 8/10
While the cream is more than I liked for tiramisu, the much higher than average use of alcohol helps mellow the overall sweetness of the dessert, making it surprisingly balanced in flavor and an enjoyable dessert to cap off the meal!

I really enjoyed my meal at Magosaburo. Even if you don't like BBQ, I would still highly recommend this place as the other non-BBQ related items (i.e. Tiramisu and Chawanmushi) are still really well-made.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CUaDw3QPQm8/","2021-09-29T13:26:30+0000","17854789682636348"
"Ah Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee : 8/10

I came to Hong Lim Food Centre to try the famous Sungei Road Laksa stall, only to find out that it wasn't open. This was the best accidental find that I could have that day.

Ah Heng Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee ($5): 8/10
Even though the coconut milk wasn't overpowering every other flavor, it was still very noticeable throughout the broth.
I doubted the high amount of coconut milk used in the broth, but a taste of the curry after adding the chilli cleared all my doubts.
While being very spicy and fragrant, the chilli didn't hit you instantly like most other chillis. Instead, it was much more subtle on the palate, and you mostly felt the gradual heat on your palate after each sip. A high level of coconut milk was necessary to ensure that the spiciness could be tempered so you could enjoy the spice instead of being attacked by it.
The mee was just the right texture, and its slight starchy taste paired well with the heavy curry.
The chicken was the most surprising part of the meal for me. Most chickens boiled in soups are flavorless and stringy, but the chicken was springy and was seasoned well.

Overall, I was surprised at how tasty the noodles were. If you don't like high amounts of coconut milk in your curries, this might not be for you. Nevertheless, I would ask you to give it an open mind and see if this changes your mind! Do come early as the queue in peak hours becomes really long really quickly!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CT95SC3pTcB/","2021-09-18T14:56:10+0000","17925159496836781"
"Igokochi Dining Bar: 8.5/10

I already knew this would be the place I visit for my 2000 follower post. This page reinvigorated my passion for the page when I went once before, so I thought it would only be fitting to revisit it for my milestone celebration.

Toku Set ($159)
The sashimi is exquisite.
They import seafood three times a week to ensure that fish is served as fresh as possible. Like any good omakase, the chef’s technique leaves you enthralled before the first bite. Every bite into the sashimi is as sweet as the ones I had back in Japan.

The highlights of the meal are the eggplant miso soup (3rd pic) and the wagyu foie gras rice dish. (1st pic)

The eggplant miso soup warms the soul. The density and richness of the miso, along with the bite of the eggplant, reminded me of the ABC soup that I would have whenever it was a cold rainy day, and the warm fuzziness I felt is a pleasant surprise from an omakase.
The wagyu foie gras is the definition of luxury. The two types of meat just melt in your mouth, permeating your tastebuds with sweetness and luxuriousness. Even though I ate this weeks ago, I can still vividly remember the bliss and satisfaction from every bite.

Igokochi is one of the few places I would highly recommend to anyone. The Asahi is one of the best I have ever drunk, and their service is one of the best around. The only reason why I didn’t rate this any higher is that it’s pricy for the cost of the food they serve. Still, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a special meal to remember.

On a special note, thank you to everyone who has supported me so far in this journey. Since the end of last year, I’ve been declining in growth, so I was extremely touched when I achieved this milestone. I am genuinely grateful to M and P for your help, and I hope I won’t disappoint you two as often from now on. Here’s to 3k followers and more to come!

P.S: There were more pictures of sushi that were served, I just felt it would be repetitive.

"A-Roy Thai Restaurant: 8/10
Thai restaurants in Singapore are not that great. The tom yum is usually too salty, the kang kong is drenched in oil, and the green curry is cloyingly sweet. However, this restaurant is unlike the rest of them, and I believe you won't be disappointed in most of its dishes.

Tom Yum Talay ($15.90): 8.4/10
You can tell that the soup has been properly prepared when there is no hint of instant tom yum flavor you would expect from using powder in the broth. 
As a result, the sweet and spicy flavors are infused much more deeply in the broth, and the acidity helps the soup have some bite, which keeps each sip refreshing. The perfect balance of flavors shows the chefs' effort into the dish, and I highly recommend this to any Tom Yum lover.

Pad Pak Bung ($10.90): 8/10
The intensity of the wok hei flavor in the kang kong would make Uncle Roger proud, and the firmness of the vegetables makes each bite satisfying. Unfortunately, this can't be rated any higher as the kang kong is just slightly too sweet, which takes away from its signature flavor and dampens the overall experience.

Kung Ob Woonsen ($18.90): 8/10
If the wok hei of kang kong made Uncle Roger proud, the vermicelli would send him to heaven.
Apart from the wok hei, the fragrance and sweetness of the vermicelli fill your senses immensely. Due to the black pepper used in the dish, the closest dish in taste that I can compare this to is black pepper crab, and each bite of the glass noodles leaves you wanting more.

Kaeng Khiao Wan ($15.90): 7/10
Unfortunately, the green curry was overly sweet. However, the curry's strong fragrance and the extremely tender meat were redeeming qualities that helped this dish remain palatable.

The dishes at A-Roy were delicious, and I highly recommend them. The issue I have is the inconsistent standards of the food, as the green curry was much better when I had it previously. Even with its ups and downs, I still think anyone who likes Thai food should check this place out!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CSwsvdABU6w/","2021-08-19T15:25:04+0000","18246609568007091"
"FeatherBlade: 8/10
This is probably the most popular place I have ever reviewed. As a result, I couldn’t help but be apprehensive due to my previous experiences with popular restaurants. (Rubato and The Sushi Bar)

Classic Steak ($21): 8.2/10
My doubts about the restaurant were cleared when I took the first bite.
Due to it being a feather blade, the steak has a tougher texture than the ribeye/sirloin steaks one might usually eat. The trade-off is that this steak has a much bolder and beefier flavor than those steaks and that pairs perfectly with salt and pepper for a delectable main course.

Mushrooms ($9): 5.9/10
As always, I was disappointed with the sauteed mushrooms. The mushrooms weren’t dried nearly enough before sauteeing, and you can see the oil and water sitting at the bottom of the bowl. As a result, the mushrooms didn’t have intensity, and I felt I was eating rubber at times instead.

Potatoes ($9): 7.7/10
The savory richness provided by beef fat paired well with the sweetness of the ikura to infuse  flavor into the mash. This, combined with the varying textures of smooth mashed potato and chunky potato bits, makes every bite exciting for the palate. 

Dark Chocolate Mint ($18): 7/10
I would recommend people order the alcoholic variant of this dessert. Without the alcohol, the milkshake had no body and only had sweetness as its selling point. The milkshake thus tasted less like a dessert to end the meal and more like a surefire way to get diabetes.
The ONLY reason why this isn’t rated lower is due to the cookie, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭. 
The molten chocolate inside the cookie from @chatsworthcookies was delightful on the palate, and the intelligent addition of salt helped prevent the cookie from tasting cloyingly sweet. With the natural bitterness of chocolate, the motley of flavors helped create a perfect dessert to end the meal on.

The FeatherBlade is a decent choice for most steak lovers. Once one gets used to the difference in the cuts of steak, they will undoubtedly enjoy the food that FeatherBlade provides. Along with the ambience the restaurant offers, this makes it a good choice for your loved ones!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CSN_TxpqL4j/","2021-08-06T03:53:54+0000","18126257068232657"
"Simei Penang Laksa Speciality [#01-199 at Yuhua Market & Hawker Centre]: 7.5/10

I have always considered the Penang version to be superior to the Singaporean version of char kway teow. However, since the quality of the Kway Teow dropped at IVINS IVINS, I have not been able to satisfy my craving for this dish. I decided to bet that the long queue at this stall meant something about the dish's quality.

The first thing that was striking was the heavy wok hei flavor throughout the kway teow. The smokiness, paired with the mild chili permeating throughout the dish, makes each bite lively. 

The other thing that surprised me was how well the egg was cooked.
The egg was extremely fluffy while slightly crispy around the edges, which helped bring various textures to the dish. This helped bring the different components together and made the dish what it is.

This was one of the better Penang char kway teow I had in recent memory. Please note that the queue times for this stall are particularly long, so do come early to avoid the queue! Coming with friends is also recommended so they can help chope seats while you wait in line :)","https://www.instagram.com/p/CR3sQGoHNQa/","2021-07-28T12:04:05+0000","18242333737048964"
"The Lokal: 8.2/10 

T-bone Steak: 8.5/10
This was my first time eating a T-bone steak, and I was pleasantly surprised by it.
The T-bone steak contained a braised flavor I did not expect, and this, along with its natural beefiness, made the taste much more complex and compelled me to go for more bites.

Truffled Mash: 8/10
With the decadence provided from the butter, the mash itself was already a super tasty standalone dish. 
But when eaten as a side, the steak juices added a complementory savouriness to the richness of the mash, which made both dishes that much more exciting to eat.

Mixed Green Salad: 6/10
The salad felt a bit tasteless, dressed with a balsamic vinegar sauce considerably mild in flavor. It was akin to eating raw, unseasoned vegetables fresh out of the supermarket aisle, which I’m personally not a big fan of.

Sauteed Mushrooms: 7/10
While I could taste the umami, it could be further intensified if the  mushrooms were dried more before being sautéed. A more intense flavor could also have better complemented the much milder salad as the vegetables would provide crunch without undermining the savoriness of the mushrooms.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at The Lokal. Though the wait for dishes was a bit longer than I think it should have been, the friendly atmosphere and the helpful services more than made up for it, and I wouldn't mind coming back more often if the side dishes were just a tinge better :)","https://www.instagram.com/p/CRbnVN8nIJ5/","2021-07-17T14:22:21+0000","17924091253687837"

Old Airport Road is a place I find overrated. Not only is it on the opposite side of Singapore, but the food it offers also isn't all that great. However, this stall made me reconsider the viewpoint I have.

Coconut Tart ($1.5): 8.2/10

I enjoyed this way more than I should have for someone who doesn't like coconut dishes and desserts.

While the coconut permeates every bite, its surprising mildness prevents it from overwhelming every bite. This mild sweetness, paired with its rich buttery texture, makes it the perfect small bite.

Overall, this is probably one of my best finds in 2021. The butter bun is also one of the best I have tried, so I can bet that the rest of the pastries are excellent too!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CQvwENPHsIZ/","2021-06-30T13:32:05+0000","17872077275458088"

After trying one of the three famous unagi restaurants in Singapore, I couldn't help but wonder if the other 2 unagi restaurants had the same level of quality to their food. Man Man does not disappoint.

Hitsumabushi ($26.8): 8.3/10
It has the signature flavor of all unagi dishes: the savory, charred taste paired with a sweet sauce that lingers on your palate. What sets Man Man apart from the rest is its ability to use the sides to help keep the sauce from overpowering the dish.
The high-quality wasabi adds a pungent spice to the dish without making your nostrils feel tortured, adding complexity and a depth of flavor to the meal. At the same time, the robust earthy soup also helped keep the dish from being too decadent. Acidity through the pickles cuts through the richness of the unagi, and the 3 sides work together to help keep the dish balanced and enjoyable.

Overall, I would say that I really enjoyed Man Man. However, the seats in the restaurants are HIGHLY limited, so much so that waiting an hour in the blistering heat is a regular occurrence at peak timings, so do come early to get seats!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CQKv4fHH3lE/","2021-06-16T04:38:35+0000","17919980413708528"

Mother's Day is particularly significant for me, so I try to find good restaurants to have a dinner for the most important woman in my life.

Tiramisu ($16): 7/10
I was afraid the tiramisu would be too jelak due to the ratio of cream to sponge aesthetically, but the liquor helps keep the tiramisu light. However, the severe lack of sponge made me feel more like I was slurping down cream than a cake.

Soup of the day [Seafood Soup] ($22): 7.7/10
The seafood soup is very rich and sweet, but it doesn’t feel too intense in flavor due to the addition of acidity from lemons, which helps the soup from becoming too strong for the palate. 
The bread is particularly notable, and I would say it’s one of the best slices of bread I have eaten. The bread is insanely crispy and buttery, and it helps add texture and contrast to the soup.

Costata Di Manzo ($60): 8.5/10
This is definitely the best steak dish I have eaten in 2021. The steak is what would you expect at a premium price: juicy, savory goodness with a tinge of salt and pepper for flavor. 
The potato, hidden under the steak at first glance, is what steals the show. The outside of the potato has just a tinge of crispiness, and biting through it allows you to taste the fluffy, creamy and velvety flesh that makes you crave another bite instantly. 
The only issue I had was that I didn’t have enough potatoes.
However, what stops this dish from being even better were the vegetables. They were way too salty, and the seasoning felt so much clumsier relative to the steak and the potatoes.

Overall, I would say that my mum and I really enjoyed this place. I really want to thank the staff for the extra food they gave (the added chocolate for dessert and a complimentary appetizer on the last image). The food quality is excellent, and I would recommend that you book this place (as seats are limited) for special occasions with your loved ones.","https://www.instagram.com/p/COkq_FuHPpj/","2021-05-07T13:13:16+0000","17944674559472598"
"Eat 3 Bowls [462 Crawford Lane]: 7.4/10

When the topic of Taiwanese food came up with my friends, Eat 3 Bowls was the first restaurant out of their mouths. I really wanted to see how a restaurant could be simultaneously mentioned by friends who disagree on the food quality of every other restaurant, so I decided to go check it out.

Braised Pork Rice {Set} ($8.50): 7.4/10
The flavor of the pork rice is overwhelming. Its insane sweetness and savoriness, along with the tenderness of the pork and the fluffiness of the rice, makes each bite extremely flavorful.
However, its main strength is also its biggest weakness.
The lack of chilli and/or acidity means there's no way to help cut through the sauce's richness, so the dish feels really cloy after just a few mouthfuls.
The cabbage is also pretty average, and the soft and wet texture of the dish really doesn't complement the pork rice well.
 
 

Bubble Tea Latte {Black} ($4.30): 7/10
It's a proper Taiwanese tea, especially when you can taste the fragrance and taste of the black tea before the milk. The price is also incredibly generous, and it is a perfect pair with most of the dishes on the menu.

Overall, I would say that Eat 3 Bowls is a decent option for Taiwanese food. However, @8degreesatsg definitely is my pick for the best Taiwanese food in Singapore. When I left at 12pm, the queue was ridiculous even for popular restaurants, so do come early or be prepared to wait a long time before you can eat!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CONqvY5HGuk/","2021-04-28T14:48:35+0000","18201726025077226"
"The Carving Board: 8.1/10

I have little faith in good food in the west, but if anything can change my opinion, it is an excellent Western place.

Aglio Olio ($13): 7.5/10
Besides making the common mistake of not being garlicky enough, the surprising spiciness helps separate it from other aglio olios. The prawns were fresh and were unbelievably juicy, and the noodles were al dente.
It's a decent aglio olio.

250g AUS Grain-fed Ribeye Steak ($26): 8/10
The steak itself was tasty. It had just the right amount of salt and pepper, which complemented its beefy taste. The mushroom-based sauce is the average brown sauce you would expect, and I personally liked the steak without the sauce. The use of balsamic vinegar as the sauce base for the salad added sweetness that helped keep the savoriness and the saltiness of the steak down.
However, the main highlight of the dish was the fries. The fries are the best I have eaten in the past year. Though I question the restaurant's marketing as the fries were more like wedges, that doesn't take away from how crispy and fluffy the wedges are. It also had just the right amount of salt to add flavor to its incredible texture.

Overall, The Carving Board is indeed an excellent place for Western food. The ambience is perfect for group meetings with your old mates, and the food and drinks (particularly the Asahi Black beer) is ideal for catching up and reminiscing with them!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CN7ih1ynxPP/","2021-04-21T13:50:30+0000","17916990769628709"
"Ramen Nagi [Suntec City]: 8.1/10

It's hard to find a ramen that I genuinely enjoy after visiting Japan, but Ramen Nagi's reputation has made me hope for ramen that I can eat without feeling disappointed. 

Original King [With Egg] ($15.90): 8.2/10

The second picture has my chosen modifications to the broth, so you might understand some of my comments here.
Nagi is the best ramen I have eaten so far (after Hototogisu became worse). 

The noodles are al dente. The broth reminds me of the ramen I ate in Japan. It is a broth with the depth and richness of the tonkotsu without saltiness. Of course, it still falls short of the original and tastes slightly saltier than it should, but it's the best imitation of what a Japanese broth is.
The slight spice adds complexity and an extra layer of flavor to the broth. This helps prevent one's attention from being focused too much on the soup's saltiness while also making the soup more intense.
The only issue is the pork, which I believed had a slight rancid flavor, but I think that was just a consistency issue as my friend's pork was pretty standard in taste.

Overall, Ramen Nagi is definitely the place to go for tonkotsu ramen. The queue is quite long in peak hours, so do take note to come earlier to avoid the lines.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CNFawROnlWs/","2021-03-31T13:23:35+0000","17875943846327389"
"Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle: 8/10

One of the reasons I started on this food journey was due to the Michelin list. In particular, Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle intrigued me the most, and it was one of the first places I went to just to try the food to see how good it was. 

It's still good now.

Pork Noodle ($6): 8/10
There are two types of mee pok; the ketchup base and the other being the vinegar base. I always believed that the vinegar base is superior, and this mee pok is the best of vinegar based mee pok.

The noodles are the definition of ""qq"". It doesn't just taste like boiled flour, and the texture fully complements the sour and spicy sauce. The pig liver also does not have the usual powdery texture that I loathe, even though I know this might be against the norm for most.
Unlike many other places, the soup isn't a random side dish served, and the pepperish flavor of the soup with the umami added from the seaweed helps prevent the pork noodle sauce from being too cloying.

Overall, even though it wasn't as great as I remembered it to be, it's still the best mee pok by far in Singapore. Even though this might be too vinegarish for some, I would nonetheless suggest that you try this at least once. How ever, do be prepared to wait for 30-40 mins for a queue that looks 10mins long. I believe you wouldn't be disappointed for the wait!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CMpFQ2nHp8D/","2021-03-20T13:17:03+0000","18205119910025661"
"Kota Zheng Zong Bak Kut Teh [Serangoon Gardens]: 7.5/10
Herbal bak kut teh is the superior bak kut teh. Even though my friends have gotten me to try some good pepper bak kut teh, nothing beats that earthy fragrance and flavor for me. However, I couldn’t find a proper herbal bak kut teh, until my sister recommended me this place!

Premium Bak Kut Teh ($16.60) [Add on Hua Tiao Wine]: 7.5/10
Eating this with my Malaysian mum is just a nostalgic kick.

Even though it wasn’t as rich and flavorful as I wanted it to be, the familiar fragrance and herbal taste permeated the entire soup. The pork meat wasn’t hard and flavorless, but was tender and falling off the bone, unlike many places. You Tiao added into the soup is the flavor bomb you would expect it to be, though the You Tiao could honestly be a bit more crispy.

Overall, I really enjoyed this place. If I didn’t live so far away from Serangoon, I would probably come here much more often to eat! I would say that take this with a grain of salt as this only has a reluctant thumbs-up of approval from my mum, so I wouldn’t know for sure it’s my nostalgia or my palate rating this.
All I can say is that this is much better than any herbal bak kut teh you can find in Singapore.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CL3v34KH6ig/","2021-03-01T09:27:21+0000","17958391204399460"
"Lighthouse Bistro: 7.9/10
I didn’t plan to eat at this place. My mum asked me for an impromptu food place at Lavender and this came up first on Google Reviews! I was ambivalent on the star rating, as high star places have always disappointed me (Cut and Rubato) come to mind, so I didn’t have too many expectations for this.

Sous Vide Aust Rib Eye ($28): 8.2/10
I always wanted to try sous vide steak, but I never found a place that sells it till now.

And I can say, sous vide steak just HITS different.

As expected from sous vide steak, it is perfectly mid-rare throughout the steak, and the perfect texture of the steak combined with the standard gamy and salty flavors you would expect makes each mouthful a delight.
Umami lovers would also enjoy the shitake mushrooms that provide a savory and sweet taste to the steak. 
The only slight issue is the potatoes, as I feel that the potatoes could use more butter, but considering the rest of the parts of the meal, this is more of a nitpick than an actual issue.

Medley of Mushroom ($8): 7.1/10
Even though this mushroom soup contains all the faults that you would expect for any average mushroom soup (being slightly too salty and watery), the strong earthly flavor paired with just the right amount of creaminess still makes this a fantastic soup to enjoy.
The garlic bread was also too mild in garlic taste, especially when compared to its level of richness.

Lighthouse’s Mornington Salad ($10): 6.5/10
Unlike most salads, the sesame dressing was too weak, so the vegetables just tasted like bland grass instead. The steak, while a nice addition to the dish, couldn't save the rest of the dish from being tasteless and disappointing.

Overall, I really enjoyed Lighthouse Bistro. The price is cheap considering the quality and quantity of food given, especially for the Sous Vide steak. Do take note that seats are limited, so do reserve a place before enjoying the food here with your loved ones!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CK858u4FZyz/","2021-02-06T13:00:13+0000","17887603579930565"
"Atlas Coffeehouse: 8.1/10
When my friends asked me to go to Atlas, I was shocked as I thought they were referring to the bar. Little did I know, there was such a famous café with the same name! As their recommendations never failed me thus far, I was extremely hyped for the visit!

Atlas Butterscotch Banana Pancake ($18): 7.6/10
This dish was 𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐩𝐭𝐮𝐨𝐮𝐬. The pancakes were heavy on the palate, with a mild sweetness to boot. The butterscotch was crispy and added a separate texture to the dish. The ice cream being light on the palate helped strike the perfect balance for the entire dish, so the dish didn’t feel too cloying. 

However, I still felt this was just a weaker version of the next dish.

Candied Bacon Waffles ($14): 8.1/10
This was just the banana pancake but better. The crispy texture is now applied to the main component of the dish, and it adds further contrast between the textures of the waffles and the ice cream. The candied bacon also adds an extra savory flavor that pairs well with the sweetness and richness of the ice cream. In a nutshell, this was just the banana pancake with further complementary flavors and textures.

Overall, I really enjoyed Atlas Coffeehouse. Unlike other similar brunch places, the prices are much cheaper and much more affordable for everyone. On top of that, the coffee and tea that they provide are top-notch beverages that pair fantastically well with their brunch meals! The queue to the café is ~20-30 mins long, so do come earlier to get seats if you are planning to have a great time with your friends!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CKgolb7n3Gc/","2021-01-26T13:29:45+0000","17904806857679009"
"Tanuki Raw [Jewel Changi Airport]: 7.4/10

When I first went to Jewel, I was thoroughly disappointed with the food options they had. The two meals there were both the most overpriced and disappointing meals of 2020. However, when my friend recommended Tanuki Raw as an alternative for Unagi, I couldn’t help but be curious about it.

Charcoal-grilled Char Siew Unagi ($21): 7.2/10

As expected, the unagi brings a rich and flavorful taste to the dish. However, the charcoal-grilled method in which the unagi was prepared adds a mellow flavor that helps keep the dish grounded and from being too cloying. The acidity that the pickled onions provided also helped prevent the dish from being too heavy on the palate, and in my opinion, could have been even more acidic to add a greater contrast to the flavors of the dish.
However, this dish pales in comparison to the Unagi at Unagiya Ichinoji due to its flaws.
The onsen egg takes the dish too over the top, and it can make the dish easily too heavy for some people to enjoy. I also felt that the amount of rice was too much to handle, and the leftover rice I couldn’t finish just felt wasted to me.

Overall, Tanuki Raw is above average for its price, and I think it’s not a bad place to eat at Jewel. There are better unagi options out there (Man Man and Unagiya Ichinoji come to mind), but this isn’t a terrible choice. Furthermore, fresh oysters at $2/pc during happy hour is a big steal and the drinks aren’t bad either!","https://www.instagram.com/p/CKJA6Q0H6oC/","2021-01-17T09:20:32+0000","17917847152543678"
"The Fardello (Part 2): 8.5/10

If you haven’t seen Part 1 of the review, please read that first!

Salmon: 8.4/10
My friends all know I hate cooked salmon. The salmon I eat is always white, bland and a waste of money. This salmon however was cooked quite pinkish, aiming for a medium-rare that melts in your mouth, while the crispy salmon skin is honestly to die for. The sweetness of the fish paired really well with the smoked salt used and gave the dish wonderful balance. Moreover, while the dish was prepared on extremely short notice, it was still perfectly seasoned. 
The only complaint is that due to the short notice we gave, the salmon was defrosted in the microwave so it could be prepared in time for our meal. Despite that, the rareness of the salmon was great, but would definitely be much better if we notified the chef earlier.

Scallops: 7.8/10
The last time I ate cooked scallops, it was the terrible ones I had at Bread Street Kitchen. However, this experience was much better. The scallops were fresh and sweet, and avoided the rubbery nature of being overcooked. In addition, this time I got a pair of cooked scallops, one covered with cheese and one without. While I already enjoy scallops immensely, this time I quite enjoyed the one paired with cheese even though I wasn’t expecting to. Paired with cheese, the scallop surprisingly became more mellow as the cheese helped keep the sweetness down, which is perfect for those looking for a gentler dish.

Overall, I really enjoyed this private dining experience, which served great food and a cosy, homely vibe. Furthermore, the care the chef shows for his guests and his food are impeccable. While the two dishes featured in part 2 aren’t a part of the pre-opening set meal, during our conversation, he heard that my friend and I were both extremely fond of salmon and scallops, and prepared them for us on the spot despite not needing to. I heavily recommend this place to everyone, which is honestly a steal in both value and quality!

"The Fardello (Part 1): 8.5/10

At the end of 2020, my good friend invited me to  a private dining session located snugly in Hougang. Private dining has always intrigued me, and the experience we had proved to be an excellent way to end off the year.

The Pre-Opening Set Meal ($25): 8.5/10
I always knew private dining was great, but I couldn’t believe it was 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 good. 

Carbonara: 8.5/10
My friends all know I hate carbonara. The only pasta I ever order outside is aglio olio, because most carbonaras I’ve had were often unpalatable. The cream is usually either too thick, heavy and cloying, bland, or overly-salted, or a mixture of all three.
This carbonara is different.
While the carbonara was creamy, it went down like silk. When I took my first bite, I was thoroughly confused because this went against all I knew about carbonaras from the experiences I’ve had with them before. Unlike others, this was one I could keep eating without it being cloying. The pasta was also perfectly salted, and this is one of the few pastas I didn’t add a copious amount of red pepper flakes into. 

Prawn with Chicken Roulade on Creamy Mashed Potatoes: 8.6/10
This is a dish of perfect complements.
While it’s served as a side dish, it didn’t play second fiddle to the sublime main course. The mashed potatoes are some of the best of what you’d expect from homemade mashed. It carried a chunky texture that paired perfectly with gentle luxuriousness that came from the careful use of butter. On top of that, the smoky-salty taste of the tender chicken roulade added the perfect kick to the dish, and I couldn’t help myself from asking for extras from the chef.

"Angus House (Part 2): 8.3/10

This is part 2, do check out part 1 for the other dishes!

Rib Eye Steak [250g]: 8.4/10
For the steaks that I have eaten in Singapore, this is in my top 3. The sweet and salty sauce is perfect with the gaminess of the beef. The herb butter on top adds a richness to the steak to take it over the top. 𝐇𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫, the vegetables are not to par. The long beans and carrots are bland, and its texture is comparable to their boiled counterparts.

Dessert: 7.4/10
A decent dish to end off the meal. The cake in particular, wasn’t too sweet, so it helped keep the dessert light on the palate.

Overall, I really enjoyed my Christmas meal at Angus House. Even though this is a special occasion, I indeed have gone to this place on regular days, and I can confirm that it’s still as good. Their salad in particular, is a big upgrade compared to the paper rolls. The ambience is perfect for a good time with your loved ones and friends, and I can guarantee the regular days ($~80 for a set) is also more affordable for everyone!

P.S: This was the first place I put on my personal IG, and also one of the ones I posted on my old food account!

"Angus House (Part 1): 8.3/10

One half of Christmas is desserts. The other half is a good hearty meal. I didn’t manage to have time to go to my usual place for Christmas this year (@bsksingapore please have more seats open TT), but this wasn’t a bad choice either!

Christmas Set ($112): 8.3/10

Pan-Seared Lobster & Threadfin Fish served with Porcini sauce: 7.7/10

The sweetness of the lobster is perfect for a starter. The fish, however, is slightly overcooked.

Bread: 8/10
I know some people won’t believe this, but this bread could be even better than BSK. The bread is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and the fragrance just wafts through your nose as you take a bite.

Cream of Mushroom: 8/10
A mushroom soup that can emanate so much earthy flavor while remaining creamy is few and far between. If you enjoy a less creamy soup, adding fresh black peppercorns allows the soup to take on a spicy fragrant flavor that you might enjoy instead.

Turkey rice paper rolls served with Sweet chili sauce: 6/10
The sweet chili sauce doesn’t complement the paper rolls, and I think a Vietnam style salty chili sauce would be preferable instead.

"Old Coffee Place [Jurong West 505 Market & Food Centre] {CLOSED}: 8.3/10 

Between arabica and robusta beans, I think more people are familiar with the latter from their childhood experiences of seeing  their older relatives drinking kopi o siu dai. 
For me personally, I really enjoy kopi but Singapore kopi usually either gives me headaches or just doesn't taste well.

This is different.

Kopi siu dai ($1.10): 8.3/10

This kopi is just nostalgic for me. 
It has the strong, slightly sweet kopi fragrance that makes me smile in anticipation.
It has the sweet, slightly bitter taste that I remember and love. 

What it doesn't have is the acidity that is present in a lot of other Singapore coffees, which means it doesn't leave this nasty aftertaste in your tongue common to many coffees.

Overall, this is the perfect coffee to start any day with, and it's Malaysian certified too. (By my mum and her employees) If you are in the food centre, this is the perfect drink to pair your meals!

P.S: I actually reviewed the mee hoon kuey before as well, do check it out if you love those soupy dishes!

"Ichikokudo Ramen [Suntec City]: 7.5/10

In preparation for the Jurong Point branch opening tommorow, along with my friend's recommendation upon hearing my lament of terrible ramen in Singapore, let's review Ichikokudo!

Ichikokudo Ramen [Extra Rich] ($13.90): 7.5/10

I won't consider myself a ramen expert, but I think personally this is the 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 broth of any ramen place I have tried.

The main reason that the chicken broth, while being really rich in flavor isn't 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐲 salty. That's the one downside I find for other ramen places, like Keisuke, as those broths while being rich, will also give me high blood pressure in the process.

Another side effect of using chicken over pork is that the meat is really tender and flavorful, as compared to the flavorless chashu that many other places have. (I also feel that the weakest part of Ichiran is their chashu, so do take note of my bias.

However, what pulls the rating down so hard is the terrible quality of the noodles.

The noodles are 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 soft and provide no bite. I felt that I was just slurping broth down my throat, and I was just drinking really good chicken soup instead of eating ramen.

Overall, I would say that Ichikokudo is probably still better than most ramen franchises in Singapore, and it's definitely worth a visit to try it yourself. It has a lot of potential, and I could see myself easily rating this much higher if I went again in the future. 

For all westsiders, the Jurong Point branch opens tommorow, 4th December, so if you want to try a ramen that isn't utterly terrible in the West (looking at you Ajisen), you now have the chance to do so!

"D' Life: 7.5/10

I always had a penchant for Herbal Bak Kut Teh, and when my friend recommended me Bak Kut Teh, from a 𝐯𝐞𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐧 restaurant no less, I couldn’t help but be intrigued by it.

Bak Kut Teh with Rice ($7.50): 7.6/10 

𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 a decent bak kut teh in Singapore.
I grew up in a Malaysian family, and as such I always had high standards for bak kut teh after tasting the ones in Malaysia.
This is really good. One problem with many Singaporean versions is that the soup tastes watery, but the flavor of this bak kut teh fully permeates the soup. The herbal taste is pronounced too, albeit much weaker as compared to the intensity of the ones in Malaysia, which I know isn’t to some people’s liking, but I found it fantastic to not be thirsty after drinking the bak kut teh here.

Cereal Prawn ($10): 7.5/10
The fake prawn is fleshy and tasty in its own way, but that’s not the reason for the high score.
The sole reason why this dish is amazing is due to its cereal.
The milk powder, along with the natural sweetness of cereal, allows the cereal to be both intensely sweet and crispy, which is addicting to the palate. It’s a perfect complement with rice, as the rice takes the edge off the sweetness while the cereal makes each mouthful so much sweeter.

Overall, I would really recommend this place to any herbal bak kut teh lovers. The dishes are also not bad, but I think it really does require an open mind and no expectations to truly enjoy. Due to the current climate of perpetual rain, I cannot think of a better way than a hot bowl of soup while talking to friends to warm the stomach and soul!

"Torasho Ramen & Charcoal Bar: 8.3/10

After the disappointment at Hototogisu, I really did believe that there was no more good ramen in Singapore. However, after recommendations from trusted friends, I had faith once more that perhaps I could once more enjoy a bowl of hot ramen in Singapore.

Lobster [Dry Ramen] ($14.60): 8.3/10
This isn’t your 𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 ramen.

The noodles are really rich and flavorful, and the onsen egg really pushes it even further to make the noodles silky smooth.
The spice is fragrant, and it strangely reminds me of the flavor in wantons. 
But those reasons aren’t the reasons why this is a 4. 

It’s the beyond 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗻𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗸 𝗵𝗲𝘆 flavor. 

The wok hey flavor is so strong, that even though the noodles should taste jelak with how rich it is, you don’t ever feel the urge to stop eating, due to how sumptuous it is.
 
The only slightly problem I have with it the croquette. The croquette, while flavorful, could be even more crispy to add another texture to the dish.

Overall, this is the only place I can recommend wholeheartedly for ramen in Singapore. Not only is this dish fantastic, but this paired with Asahi could honestly be seen as a guilty pleasure. The	Uni & Chashu tsukemen is also really good so people who enjoy tsukemen can also enjoy this place!

I have been recommended this place umpteen times every time the topic of ice cream comes up, and I finally took the time to visit it!

Dark Chocolate + Yuzu ($5): 8/10
The yuzu was pretty good. It’s really refreshing, and what most people would want eating ice cream in the sweltering heat of Singapore, albeit being an acquired taste.
However, what I did not expect was the quality of chocolate.

This is one of the few times I regret 𝐍𝐎𝐓 eating chocolate.

From a place that focuses on ice-cream, it is not unexpected that the dark chocolate is very rich, with the bittersweet taste that comes with it.
What elevates this place above everything else is how 𝐬𝐦𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐡 the chocolate is. The ease of which the chocolate just slides down your throat causes it to much lighter than you would expect, and not before long you already finished the ice cream.

This combination is even better since the refreshing and sour taste of yuzu complements the taste of the rich and light taste of the chocolate, and you really can’t stop eating.

Hainanese Kaya ($5): 7.7/10
There’s nothing much to say, other than the fact that it is sweet but not heavy on the palate, and really makes for a refreshing yet rich way to enjoy a hot summer’s afternoon.

Overall, this is a perfect place to just enjoy yourself, especially considering the blistering weather that Singapore can bring. They also give huge portions relative to the cost of the ice cream, and I would highly recommend this to any ice cream lover. There’s few seats inside, so please do note that you might not be able to find seats in peak hours, and be prepared to queue for ~10-15 minutes if there’s no seats.

"Lolla (Part 2): 9/10

Could Lolla disappoint me after the fantastic dishes in Part 1? 

Hand torn pasta with Brown Crab ($39): 8.4/10
If a word could summarize this dish, it would be complex.

The seafood combines with the creaminess of the pasta to create a sweet, salty and velvety taste.

The pasta is just the right thickness to not be doughy yet still provide a mouth feel, which accompanies beautifully with the firm flesh of the crab.

Crema Catalana ($18): 6.5/10
This was my least favorite dish. 
The dish is technically well done, the crust passes the sound test and the custard itself is silky smooth.

However, I couldn’t appreciate the orange taste added into the dish, as I feel it really didn’t complement the richness of the custard.

Vanilla Ice Cream ($10): 9.1/10
This was non-ironically, not only the best ice cream I had in Singapore, but the best dish of the night.

The ice cream is 𝐬𝐨 𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 and creamy. The sweetness is not even that pronounced and noticeable due to how light the ice cream is.

I usually hate ice cream because I feel so bloated at the end, but this dish was such a perfect way to end off on a light note.

Overall, Lolla is a fantastic place to take a loved one for a special occasion. The fantastic service and ambience, along with their exquisite dishes, really helps elevate Lolla to another level. Do remember to book early! (Someone took my canceled reservation within 10 minutes!!!)

On another note, thank you for staying with me thus far. When I started this account, I just wanted to put pictures of food I love and share it with my friends. I just thought this would be a hobby I would drop in a month, but its been a fun journey from then to now. All my thanks to you guys and I hope you would continue to join me on this food journey!

"Lolla (Part 1): 9/10

For my 50th post, I wanted to review something truly fancy, and this place which I brought my good friend to for her birthday seems like a perfect place for such an occasion.

Duck Fat Potatoes ($17): 7.7/10
When this was the first dish served, I knew this place would be fancy.

The smell that came was absolutely glorious. The texture is fantastic, and is amazingly crispy on the outside with the chunky potato texture inside. The duck fat adds a lot of flavor to the potato. 

However, what drags the score down is that the crust is overly salted, which dampens the taste of the dish.

Spanish Tortilla with Jamon Iberico ($29): 7.5/10
The tortilla is really creamy and seasoned beautifully. The iberico pork itself is very soft and sweet, and the thin slices of potato in the tortilla breaks apart in the mouth.

The potato also helps keep the dish from being too cloying due to the creaminess and the richness of the eggs.

Grass-fed Ribeye Steak ($78): 8.6/10
The picture does not do justice to the aroma and the flavor of this dish.

If you charge $78 for a steak, it better be of this quality.

The beef is a perfect midrare, and the seasoning of the beef results in a salty yet charred taste that reminds me of the wok hey flavor.

The genius of the dish, is pairing it with caramelized onions. 
The sweetness, oiliness and creamy caramelized onions contrasted perfectly with the salty and slightly dry beef, resulting in a dish where you just can’t help but keep on eating.

Continue on Part 2 to see the other fantastic dishes I ate at Lolla!

"8 degrees : 7.7/10

I have a soft spot for Taiwanese food, as Taiwan was the first overseas experience I truly enjoyed. Now, several years later, when my friend recommended this place, I couldn’t help but get excited for it.

Pork Belly Rice [L] ($5.80): 7.6/10

This was a delicious 卤肉饭. The tender braised pork meat melts in your mouth. It's extremely rich, and its salty and savory taste lingers on your tongue. The sauce is a tad bit oily, but that downside is mitigated due to its pairing with rice.
The aspect that puts it above the rest is the chili. The chili is spicy and fragrant, and the acidity and garlic of the chili not only helps add complexity, but its bright flavours also helps cut through the rich flavours of the dish.

Cheese Fries ($4.80): 6.7/10
The cheese fries weren’t cloying as the spice seasoning does help cut through the fat. However, the fries were too soft for me.

Milk Tea with Pearl [L] ($5.80): 7/10
@playmadeonezo , this is what you call Taiwan milk tea.
The earthy fragrance of tea, as one would expect from Taiwanese milk teas, is at the forefront of the drink, and the foam on the top is an interesting addition. However, the pearls were far too firm for me.

Lemon Aiyu with Passionfruit ($3.80): 7.3/10
This is one of my favorite desserts, and they did it justice. The drink is sweet and acidic without it being heavy on the palate. One of the most refreshing ways to end off a meal.

Overall, I do recommend this place to friends and family who would want a revisit to the Taiwanese dishes they fondly remember in their travels. While this place does have ~20min queue time, this place has the perfect ambience for a meeting with friends and the pricing is really affordable.","https://www.instagram.com/p/CF6VF0fFk0T/","2020-10-04T06:22:41+0000","17862955535097369"
"Heytea (Westgate): 8/10

When I went back to Heytea, I couldn’t believe that my favorite drink is taken off the menu! However, this drink is a fine replacement for the matcha.

Roasted Brown Sugar Bobo [Hot] ($5.30): 8/10

This is the Singaporean hot chocolate.

Even though the drink is really heavy, the drink being hot really makes the drink less heavy on the palate. The brown sugar pearls are also quite soft, which adds to the warm fuzziness I get from this drink, which is similar to the feeling I get from hot chocolate. 

Overall, the loss of matcha does make me sad, but this drink is a worthwhile replacement. The queue has died down a lot so I would really recommend this drink on a rainy day!

"Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee [Whampoa]: 7.2/10

I can’t help but keep on enjoying this comfort food!

Hokkien Mee ($15): 7.2/10

As a person who thinks wet hokkien mee is king, this is really good. The hokkien mee is just the right amount of wet, and the prawns are relatively fresh, considering that this is hawker centre food.
What pops out from this place is the chili. The chili is very fragrant and is very spicy. It adds a lot of heat to the dish, which I really enjoy as it makes the dish less cloy.

Overall, this really is one of the better places for hokkien mee. The queue is indeed pretty long though, and you should expect yourself to wait 10-20 mins to eat!

"Lau Wang Claypot Delights: 7.4/10

One of my favorite go-tos for cheap and good food!

Qing Long Vegetable with Beansprouts ($6): 6/10
The qing long doesn’t have the usual crunch to it that I expected, and it also had an oily aftertaste. Personally, I think the addition of black beans just worsened the overall flavor of the dish, but that could be just me as I really don’t like black beans.

Sesame Frog [1 Frog] ($8): 6.5/10
The caramelized onions were sweet but the frog did not absorb the sauce very well and tasted a bit bland.

Premium Steam Egg ($2.60): 7.4/10
The texture of the egg is silky smooth and would be one of the best 3 consistencies for steam eggs I have eaten in Singapore (The other 2 being at Sushi Bar and Magosaburou). However, the eggs could have been seasoned a bit more heavily as it was still a bit bland.

Sesame Chicken ($11): 8/10
The flagship dish of the restaurant does not disappoint. Unlike the frog, the chicken has absorbed the sauce beautifully. It is juicy, flavorful and does not taste oily. One small downside to the sauce is that it’s very heavy on the palate and can leave one rather cloyed. However, as this sauce is clearly meant to be eaten with rice, this negative really isn’t that huge.

Chicken Herbal Soup ($8.80): 8/10
Even though the soup is brimming with chicken flavor, it still feels light on the palate. The herbal taste complements the richness of the chicken well, and the usual bitterness of herbs is not present. The mild sweetness from wolfberries adds further complexity to the dish. The best part about the dish is the chicken, as it is tender and flavorful, atypical of most chicken soups as the meat is usually overcooked which results it being tough and bland.

Overall, this is one of my favorite places to hang out with friends. You do have to queue for ~30mins at peak hours as seats are limited in the restaurant, but the wait is worth it.

"Mr and Mrs Mohgan's Super Crispy Roti Prata: 7.3/10

The search for prata continues! This time, my friend recommended me this place and said: “I had to wait 1 hour the other time and I would wait again.” With such a rave review, I was stoked to visit this place.

As usual, I ordered 1 plain prata ($1) and 1 planta prata ($1.50).

The pratas were slightly bigger than palm size. However, what it loses in quantity it makes it up in quality.
The planta prata was not bad. As the namesake of the restaurant says, it’s really crispy, more so than you would expect from a planta prata, and it’s really rich. However, this doesn’t come with the usual greasiness of most planta pratas. 
The plain prata was even better. It was unexpectedly crispy, had a slightly sweet taste to it, and it wasn’t doughy. The crispiness and the thin crust of the prata made it the perfect prata to dip into curries, and I thought I had finally hit prata nirvana.

However, I was disappointed.

Don’t get me wrong, the curry is good. It’s very fragrant and has a mild spicy and tangy taste to it. There is also a spice aftertaste, which causes it to be very good at cleansing the palate. However, the curry wasn’t rich enough. It was watery, and I think this curry would fit pratas from stalls like Enaq more than its own. I personally feel that with a prata with such insane texture, a rich curry would add so much flavor to the prata rather than the milder curry I had.

Overall, the pratas from Mr and Mrs Mohgan are really good. In fact, I think the plain prata is by far the best plain prata in Singapore. However, the disappointment in the curry not complementing the prata really drops the score down. Furthermore, the wait time is ridiculous. I waited 1h+ for the pratas and seats are limited at the area. Even with all those flaws, this is probably one of the top few prata places I have eaten, and personally I would rank it only behind Divine Vegetarian pratas. (Check out my review on it!)

"Don Signature Crab: 7.8/10 (Part 2)

If you haven't checked out the yam ring and the black pepper beef reviews, please check it out in Part 1!

LaLa Prawn White Been Hoon ($20): 7.6/10
Personally, I don’t like Bee Hoon. This is as most places don’t know how to cook bee hoon properly, and every time I eat bee hoon it’s just bland. However, this place is an exception. The bee hoon has a lot of flavor, and the texture of the bee hoon helps complements with the strong flavors of the broth. 
The broth is salty, spicy, and sweet in all the right ways, and the best part about it is that it doesn’t make you feel thirsty after drinking it which are typical of strong broths.
The lala is also fresh, and it’s a pleasant experience compared to the stale clams I had at the Sushi Bar.

Superior Spinach Soup ($10): 7.6/10
The problem with most spinach soups is that either the spinach has no taste, or the broth is overly salty. However, this is pleasantly not the case. The spinach remains flavorful while the broth isn't extremely salty. It also isn’t overcooked, resulting in the spinach still being crisp. The unique take of this place is adding pepper, which helps adds a slight spice and helps to cut through the rich soup.

Overall, this is one of my favorite places to eat Zi Char. The best thing about this place is that it has consistency, and every time I have visited this place the quality hasn’t dropped significantly as compared to some of the other places I frequent. Furthermore, another good thing is how every dish I have eaten is usually nice (This is the first time I ordered the yam ring). The place is a bit hard to get to by public transport, and I would recommend coming to this place by car. The ambience is very family-friendly, and the service is excellent too :)

"Don Signature Crab (Part 1): 7.5/10

One type of restaurant I haven’t reviewed yet is a Zi Char restaurant. This was as I usually go alone to eat food, and never really had a chance to eat Zi Char. However, today’s the day to fix that hole in my Insta :)

Yam Ring ($18): 8.1/10
This is how you do yam rings well. 
The fish is cooked perfectly. The texture is perfect, where when you bite into the fish it comes out as clean pieces instead of being mushy. The chicken is juicy too. Both are coated in a spring onion ginger sauce that adds so much flavor and fragrance to the meats. The prawns are extremely fresh, and its fleshy texture along with sweetness is a nice contrast from the salty sauce for the fish and meat.
The main attraction, the yam ring, is also cooked exquisitely. The yam is extremely fragrant, and the texture of the crispy crust with the mushy and slightly chunky yam is good. The yam taste also adds an extra complexity of flavor to the sweetness and saltiness of the rest of the dish.
However, as the sauce is a bit oily, the entire dish is slightly greasy, but the quality of each part of the dish really makes this a small negative to the overall dish.

Black Pepper Beef ($12): 7.8/10
There’s a sticky feel to the beef, which is a good complement to the sauce on the beef. The black pepper isn’t added to a point where it makes your nostrils flare, and the added chili also adds fragrance to the dish. The beef also has a soft but not mushy texture, which is great!

To be continued in Part 2!

"The Sushi Bar: 7/10 (Part 2)

So far, I am really happy with the dishes I have ordered, but the quality between those I have reviewed in Part 1 and the dishes here is night and day.

Inaniwa Udon ($13.90): 6.5/10

The thin udons have a natural earthly flavor, and its stringy texture matches well with the sweet broth. However, the broth is quite overwhelmingly sweet, and I definitely can’t imagine drinking this fully. Despite that, most broths for Udons are just meant to add flavor to the noodles, and since the noodles are quite naturally bland, the broth has to compensate for it, and is usually not meant for consumption, so I wouldn’t mark it down too much on the broth.

Negitoro Hand Roll ($12.90): 5.5/10

The tuna is fresh and fatty, however the handroll tasted a bit bland and it could have been sweeter.

Asari Soup ($6.90): 4.5/10

The soup is refreshing, and it serves as a good appetizer with its saltiness and fishiness. However, the compliments end there. The clams were definitely not fresh; the clams were way too fishy and it even tasted a bit sour, which shouldn’t be for fresh clams.

Fish miso soup ($4.90): 4/10

The salmon in the soup was fresh. That is not enough to redeem this travesty of a dish. The miso soup is way too salty, and just overwhelms everything, including the sweetness of the salmon. The miso soup is also not even that strong, and there was no depth of flavor to the dish. 

Overall, the dishes are quite hit and miss. I absolutely adore both the dragon roll and the sashimi salad, but that clam soup and fish miso soup were just so disappointing. One good point to note is that the ingredients were all quite fresh, apart from the clams, and the salmon belly sashimi we wanted to order also ran out, which shows that it definitely has high quality ingredients. The queue time is quite long and you should definitely make a reservation in advance if you ever want to try it.

"The Sushi Bar: 7/10 (Part 1)

After going to Japan, Japanese cuisine in Singapore has always felt a bit off. It also doesn’t help that the usual franchises I go to (Ichiban Sushi + Sushi Tei) have deproved in quality. I always had that itch to scratch, and I really hoped that this place would finally be the redemption of Japanese cuisine in Singapore.

Dragon Roll ($25.90): 7.8/10

This was a symphony of flavors. The tempura inside is deep fried well, and it adds sweetness and crunchiness to the dish. The unagi on top adds an umami flavor which helps complement the creaminess of the avocado on top. The resulting flavor is a dish with soft, crunchy and creamy textures while tasting both sweet and salty, in the perfect way.
However, the one problem that I have is that the dish is slightly too sweet. The mayonnaise on top is just a bit too much, especially considering the inherent sweetness of both the sweet sauce and the shrimp, and it overpowers the flavors slightly.

Sashimi Salad ($19.90): 7.6/10

It sounds contradictory comparing a Chinese dish to this, but this is the best yusheng I tasted. This tastes exactly like what that Chinese New Year dish is. However, unlike most yushengs, this yusheng has the right combination of sweetness, saltiness and tanginess without either being too strong. The sashimi is also really fresh, and it adds texture and further sweetness to the dish. The radish also has a mild sweetness to it, which is really different from most Japanese salads, where the radish itself tastes quite bland and unappetizing.

Chawanmushi ($3.90): 7.6/10

This chawanmushi is one of the best I have tried in Singapore, probably behind only Magosaburou. The chawanmushi is really smooth and it has the perfect mild saltiness I would expect from chawanmushi. The salmon roe adds crunch to the dish and the mushrooms adds another texture and an earthly flavor to the dish, which complements the saltiness of the chawanmushi. 

So far, the dishes have been top-notch but remember, there’s a part two to the review!

"Divine Vegetarian Family Restaurant: 8/10

My experience with vegetarian food has always been limited; with Greendot and Elemen as the few places I have tried vegetarian food.

Plain Prata ($1.0): 8.3/10

When I came to a vegetarian restaurant that served prata, I didn’t expect it to be that great, let alone the best prata I ever had in Singapore.
The prata itself is of high quality. It is fluffy, and you can taste the butter used in the cooking. However, it is not as greasy as you expect it to be, especially since all the pratas are cooked on order.

However, what makes this prata number 1 is the curry. For a curry that does not have any meat to add flavour, I was skeptical that the curry was as good as my friend told me it would be.
The curry is thick. It coats the back of your spoon when you dip in it. It’s spicy, but not too spicy that you cannot notice the fragrance of the herbs used in the curry. The slightly sweet taste on top complemented the prata taste really well. The curry is easily the best curry I had in Singapore.

Kangkong ($6): 7.2/10

This is a different type of kangkong. The mushrooms and ginger added toned down the salty taste you expect from kangkong. The kangkong instead tasted really mellow, even though you can still taste the salty and spicy taste hidden in it. It’s also not greasy and not watery, which is really great.

Cereal Prawn ($10): 7/10

Even though this is shown as cereal prawn, the vegetarian prawn meat just tastes like crabmeat. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t great. The cereals are fragrant, and the crunchy, crispy, sweet taste of it is quite pleasing.

Overall, I would say that this place is pretty great. It has by far the best prata I had in Singapore, and the other dishes are also quite appetizing, as long as you don’t focus on its taste and not compare it to previous experiences. There’s quite a lot of seats, and the noisy atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect for gatherings with friends.

"Hong Wen Mutton Soup [#04-20 at Beauty World Centre]: 7.2/10

Mutton has been a meat that has been most hated and loved by people due to its fragrance and strong flavor. For me personally, the strong flavor does turn me off from most mutton related foods. However, this mutton soup is different as it specifically caters to those who enjoy just a milder taste of mutton.

Mutton Soup with Rice ($8.50): 7.2/10

This is a mild soup, which is quite distinct considering the meat of choice for the broth. The lamb taste is severely muted, and personally I like the hint of mutton rather than the overwhelming presence it has in most foods. The soup is also fragrant with herbs, which helps further milden the presence of mutton in the soup.

The meat is very tender, and isn’t chewy, which is a huge problem with most meat cooked in broths. The chili also pairs well with the meat, being slightly spicy and sour to add acidity to the rich taste of the lamb. Personally, I would have liked the chili to be slightly less sour as the acidity was too much, considering the mild taste of the meat.

Overall, this is one of my favorite places to eat at in the Bukit Timah region, and I have always ordered at this restaurant whenever I come here. The place is perfect with friends to eat, as there are many stalls there that are also high in quality and cheap to eat. However, staying safe is the utmost priority and know that these food stalls are waiting for you when the situation gets better :) #singapore #singaporefoodie #mutton #foodie #beautyworldcentre #hawkercentre #bukittimah #review #foodreview #bukittimahfood #foodporn #foodstagram #LoL #foodphotography #foodgasm #hawkerfood","https://www.instagram.com/p/B-1NM6DlP3w/","2020-04-11T06:57:47+0000","18045176767245647"
"Unagiya Ichinoji: 8.5/10

I have hated eel all my life, due to a bad experience with unagi before. However, due to the pressuring of both my mum and my want to experience new palates, I decided to give unagi a retry.

I was not disappointed.

Unagi & Wagyu Beef Jyu ($45.80): 8.5/10
I wonder why I ever hated unagi.
It’s sweet, salty and packed in flavor. The taste just oozes out, and there is no need for condiments for such flavorful food. The rice is cooked perfectly, and adds a second needed texture to the mushiness of the eel.
The wagyu was fatty and sweet, but it could be rendered more to add even more flavor to the wagyu. The miso is surprisingly light, but that works well to be a complement to the many strong flavors in the dish.
However, the weakest part of the dish is the chawanmushi. The chawanmushi crumbles too easily, and the lack of a firm texture hurts the overall dish.

Seafood Salad ($9.80): 7.8/10
The sashimi was really above expectations. The tuna is especially surprising, as it tasted way better than usual tuna in Singapore, and even reminded me of the tuna I ate while in Japan. The salmon belly was also fatty and tasty. The goma dressing adds earthiness to the dish, but I think the dish overall needs more acidity due to the general oily nature of both the fish and the sauce.

Overall, this place has made me change from hating unagi to fanatically loving it. The sashimi was fresh and flavorful, and was a good appetizer to the strong flavors that the unagi and wagyu both provide. However, one slight issue I had overall is that the dishes were overall really fatty, due to the fattiness of the ingredients (sashimi, wagyu and unagi are all fatty foods), so that might be a turnoff to people who feel its too greasy. The ambience and service was excellent, and it’s a good place to have a great night with either friends or loved ones you want to have a special meal with :) #singapore #singaporefoodie #unagi #foodie #tuna #sashimi #robertsonquay #review #foodreview #robertsonquayfood #foodporn #foodstagram #LoL #foodphotography #foodgasm","https://www.instagram.com/p/B98Sog9l9GV/","2020-03-20T04:28:32+0000","17848095703968260"
"Fu Ming Cooked Food [Redhill Market]: 8.3/10

Carrot cake has been a staple of hawker centre food. Regardless of the place you live, one has definitely tried before this delicacy, be it white or black, and have enjoyed it thoroughly. This carrot cake is the one I enjoy the most, and the one I would recommend to friends and family to enjoy!

White Carrot Cake ($4.00): 8.3/10

As I really don’t enjoy the overly sweet dark sauce, I have always preferred white carrot cake over black, and this is one of the best I have eaten.

The carrot cake strength is its flavor. Unlike most other carrot cakes, especially white carrot cakes which are usually quite bland, it is salty and savory. There is a wok hey flavor to the carrot cake, and the slight crisp of the eggs adds a second layer of texture to the dish alongside the soft carrot cake itself.

However, the slight downside of this place is the strength of its chili. While the slight spiciness does add to the overall flavor of the dish, it could be even more spicy to add a greater complement to the overall taste of the dish, as the strong saltiness and savoriness does hide the spiciness underneath.

Overall, I would say that this carrot cake is one of the best I have eaten in Singapore. However, I cannot give an accurate rating on the black carrot cake as I have not eaten it and would give a biased opinion on it due to my dislike of dark sauce. However, from what my friends have said, the taste of the black carrot cake is also really good, and comparable to the white. Do take note that at peak hours, the wait time for the carrot cake is quite long. However, there is table service and the portions are quite large, and that combined with the strong flavor of the dish itself makes the wait more than worthwhile.

"Muchos: 7.8/10

After Chili’s had closed down in 2019, my craving for Mexican food was unsatisfied for a good while. However, at a friend’s recommendation of Muchos, I couldn’t help but be curious whether this would be a good place to satisfy my needs.

Grilled Mexican Steak ($38.90): 8/10

This was one of the better steaks I ate so far. The beef was really tender and juicy, and the seasoning of the Mexican spices gave the steak a slightly spicy, salty taste that was quite enriching. However, the whole dish is bogged down due to the low quality of the sides. The fries were overly salty and the salad wasn’t seasoned and remained quite tasteless, in opposition to the flavorful beef.

Quesadillas [Grilled Chicken] ($12.90): 7.5/10

The strong flavor of cheese, along with the spicy salsa, helped add great flavor to the chicken. The chicken was also really juicy, which really prevented the whole dish from tasting too dry.

Tacos [Grilled Chicken]: 7.3/10

The grilled chicken was tender and spicy and it was just a good standard taco all around. It’s a soft-shelled taco, which I know might turn some people off, but I felt it was a better fit for the taste then a hardshell taco.

Overall, Muchos was a great experience. Other than the disappointing sides with the steak, the rest of the food was quite well done and I do recommend it to those who wants some Mexican food in their lives

"Bread Street Kitchen: 9/10

As Christmas is coming, I couldn’t help but have a luxury to celebrate the joyous holiday. What better place to do at one of my favorite chef’s restaurant with his signature themed special?

Beef Wellington ($80): 9/10
This is by far the most expensive dish that I have reviewed so far on the page and it does not disappoint.

The main star is amazing. The puff pastry is cooked exquisitely and doesn’t taste doughy, the mushroom duxelles provides a strong earthly flavor and the fillet mignon is cooked perfectly mid-rare. The red wine sauce also complements the dish well, especially providing much needed flavor to the fillet mignon which is quite flavorless on its own.

The mashed potatoes were surprisingly great as well. It was buttery but not too greasy, and the texture of the mashed potatoes provided a bit of bite and wasn’t grainy, and I couldn’t help but just keep on eating it. The carrots were okay as well, though they were a bit too charred for my liking.

However, the disappointment in the dish is the seasonal greens, which were way too bland and was honestly tasteless. It was also too wilted to have any form of texture whatsoever.

Overall though, I really enjoyed this luxury of a dish. The greens aside, everything else was cooked really well and I would highly recommend this dish to anyone who wants to treat themselves to something special for this occasion. However, do take note that one should definitely make a reservation in advance as it is heavily packed, and the beef wellington does take ~30 mins to prepare. There is also free bread with the most amazing butter, so the waiting time will pass by

"928 Yishun Laksa [#01-155 at 928 Yishun Central 1]: 8.4/10

As seen from my feed so far, I really love noodles, and laksa is one of my favorite noodle dishes. However, most famous laksa places has disappointed me, and I am glad that this place was not such a case.

Laksa ($3.50): 8.4/10

I usually have 3 problems with laksa. Either the broth isn’t rich enough or deep enough in flavor, or the noodles taste bland as they haven’t absorbed the flavor of the broth. This bowl of laksa has none of that. The dish smells fragrant, and there’s depth of flavor in the broth, and thus the laksa doesn’t have a water aftertaste. The noodles have great texture and doesn’t taste doughy, and absorbs the broth well enough to not be tasteless.

Overall, there isn’t much I can say about the dish other than its overall excellence and great taste. The affordability also makes this place that much more of a gem as well. However, do note that the queue for this laksa is ridiculous (had to queue 20+ minutes at 11am on a Thursday), and there are few seats at the place.

"Konjiki Hototogisu [Chijmes]: 7.5/10

Hakata Ikkousha isn’t the only famous ramen in Chijmes. One of the three only Michelin-starred ramen in Japan, it has opened outlets in Singapore, with Chijmes being the flagship outlet. As Ikkousha was alright, I also had the same expectations that Konjiki would not disappoint.

Shoyu Hamaguri Soup Ramen ($14.90): 8.2/10

This is easily the best ramen I ever had in Singapore. The unique broth, which has clams, truffle and shoyu, is refreshing to the palate. Usually, such strong flavors would be overwhelming, but each strong flavor prevents any single flavor to overpower the dish. There’s also depth of flavor, which is honestly missing from far too many ramen restaurants in Singapore. The thinner than usual ramen noodles allows for a springier and bouncy texture, which fits the broth well. The chashu is also much better, as it doesn’t have the rubbery texture and bland taste that most other restaurants have, albeit being slightly too salty. After a long day, I couldn’t help but just keep on eating bite after bite!

Overall, I would definitely say that Konjiki is better than Ikkousha, and even go so far to say that Konjiki is easily the best ramen place in Singapore. As I went during the off-peak hours, I can’t comment on the ambience of the place. One caveat to Konjiki is that the broth is really one of a kind, and it isn’t for everyone, though those that can appreciate the complexity of the broth would keep on coming back for more!

Update: The score has dipped a bit cause the clam taste in the broth has subsided noticeably and the truffle is completely muted too. However, the ramen is still really well made and it's definitely still the best ramen place in Singapore.

"HEYTEA [Westgate]: 7.8/10

HEYTEA exploded onto the bubble tea scene in Singapore, and managed to get long queues in the extremely saturated market filled with huge names such as R&B, LiHo and others. The menu was really fascinating for me and I decided to give it a try.

Brown Sugar Bobo [Matcha] ($5): 7.8/10

Not going to lie, this is probably one of my favorite bubble teas I have ever tried. Matcha provides a slightly bitter flavor, which helps tone down the naturally high sweetness of the brown sugar in the drink. The brown sugar isn’t overloaded as well, which helps the drink not be too rich and overwhelming after a few sips. The bubbles aren’t also too chewy or too soft, which adds another texture to the drink. It also absorbs both the flavor of the matcha and the brown sugar really well. This combination sounds strange but is fantastic and I highly recommend people to try it.

Overall, HEYTEA has been a pleasant experience for me to try. However, a caveat to the drink I tried is that it’s really rich and sweet so the drink isn’t for all to enjoy. The queue times for HEYTEA are quite long, even though the hype has died down a bit, and the ambience in the café itself is quite nice. Do take note that at peak hours, queuing around 20 ~ 30 mins could be expected.

"Hakata Ikkousha Ramen [Chijmes]: 7.3/10

Ramen has been a favorite of mine, especially after going on a trip to Japan the previous year. In Singapore, many places are famous for their high-quality ramen, with Hakata Ikkousha Ramen being one of them. Having gone to many other famous ramen places, I was quite excited for this!

Tonkotsu Special ($16): 7.3/10
Eating this ramen does take me back to when I was eating Ichiran in Japan. The springy noodles absorb the flavor well and the pork meat is seasoned well, albeit a bit too chewy for my taste. The ajitsuke tamago is tasty but it’s a bit overcooked. However, what this dish does insanely well is the broth.
The broth is splendid. It is flavorful, has depth of flavor (which is really rare for ramen in Singapore) and has the saltiness taste that defines the tonkotsu broth. My only main issue, as with every single other ramen in Singapore, is that the broth is very slightly too salty, but that’s a miniscule point compared to the overall level of quality the broth is at.

Overall, Ikkousha Ramen does not disappoint, and it was worth the waiting time (~20 mins at 7pm on a Friday night). However, take note that the inside of the restaurant is slightly squeezy and it is filled with social conversations, so a quiet eater might not enjoy it as much!

"Soon Hiang Png [#02-95 at Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre] : 7.7/10

Taman Jurong has been where I spent most of my teenage years. After a tiring day in school, this store’s fried rice has always been the relief that I could rely on. Even now, long after I have left my school days, this stall still hasn’t disappointed me with their nostalgic fried rice.

Fried Rice ($4.50): 7.7/10

Fried rice is one of the few dishes that I don’t think has a very low low, but also doesn’t have a very high high, due to the lack of complexity of flavors and textures in the dish. This stall’s fried rice is one of those near the apex in terms of quality. The fried rice isn’t oily, so it doesn’t feel greasy. The soy sauce allows a level of saltiness that doesn’t make the dish feel bland. The bird’s eye chili adds spice to the rice, and every element allows the fried rice to be fragrant!

Overall, a simple dish such as fried rice can still put a smile on my face, especially with the quality of the fried rice served. At peak hours, there are many people that are visiting the food centre, so do make sure to come early to have seats!

"Symmetry (Part 2): 8.4/10

As Symmetry was such a pleasant meal the other time, I couldn’t help but come back again for another brunch.

Symmetry Big Breakfast [Scrambled Eggs] ($25): 7.8/5

Their namesake Big Breakfast is also a great brunch. The many elements in the meal all help elevate each other to a greater level, albeit to not the same level of decadence that was their Eggs Benedict.

The sautéed mushrooms are good, and provides a strong earthly flavor to the meal that helps contrast with the other flavors from the other elements. It also isn’t too wet, which helps the whole meal not feel too soggy. The chicken cheese sausage is chewy, and helps provide a nice mouth feel to the whole meal.
The scrambled eggs are creamy and the salad is fresh and crunchy with a salad dressing that provides an acidic taste without being too sour. The sourdough bread isn’t soggy and its rugged taste and texture pairs well with the sweet jam. The maple-glazed bacon speaks for itself. In the end, the tater tots provide a palate cleanser to all the different strong flavors, while itself not being too oily.

However, where the meal pales in comparison to the Eggs Benedict is due to the many more imperfections each element has, which brings down the general quality of the meal. The scrambled eggs taste a bit bland, the bacon and tater tots could definitely be crispier, the sausage taste is quite generic, and the mushrooms taste could be even stronger as well. 
These are all just slight imperfections to a very good meal, and money well spent.

Overall, Symmetry has been a pleasant experience both times I have been there, with the same level of ambience and the high level of service that has made me happy both times. Again, as usual, one should definitely book in advance due to the limited number of seats in the café, and also be prepared for a brunch with friends and family!

"CHICHA San Chen [JEM]: 8.3/10
For every meal, one needs the perfect beverage to wash it down. Brewed teas have become a popular trend recently and CHICHA San Chen is one of the famous brewed tea outlets.

Black Tea + Honey (100%) + Bubble ($4.70) = 8.3/10 
In simple terms, this is the best ""Teh O Bing"" I have ever tasted.
The tea is strong, the honey adds a mild sweetness and the bubbles add a crunch to the whole drink.

Overall, the quality of the drink I ordered gives credence to the other combination of drinks to be really good as well. However, due to the slightly overcosted price and the long queue for the drink (~20mins), the overall experience is slightly worse than it should be.

"Supply and Demand: 7/10
This restaurant is famous for its high-quality western dishes, which is right up my alley.

Mushroom and Gruyere Crostini ($14): 8.2/10
This is a great starter to a meal. The mushrooms provide a strong earthly flavor, of which the mild cheese complements and doesn’t overpower the mushrooms. On top of that, the bread isn’t soggy and provides a crunch to the whole starter, making the whole dish both complex and exciting for the palate.

Puttanesca ($20): 6.7/10
This traditional pasta is pretty standard. Its strong flavor could have been helped with more acidity and the pasta could have been cooked slightly shorter to have more bite when eating.

Maiale Orientale ($20): 7.8/10
This oriental pasta is my pick of the two pastas I ordered. The oily and spiciness of the pasta is a refreshing take from the typical creamy pastas. The pasta is also al dente and the pork add saltiness to the dish. A slight recommendation is a bit more acidity to cut through the oiliness.

La Mattina Dopo ($22): 6.5/10
The pizza, while being quite unique with to its lighter taste due to the lighter cheese and sauce, requires much help. The sauce is quite bland, and the pizza tastes doughy, which just ruins the overall taste and texture of the pizza. It also doesn’t help that neither the bacon nor the mushrooms, both of which are strong flavors in the dish, stands out in the pizza.

Tiramisu ($14): 6.9/10
As my go to dessert for every western meal, Supply & Demand’s version of the tiramisu is quite typical, albeit being one of the better ones you can find in Singapore. However, it is a bit too creamy, and the cake too soft, which causes both the coffee to be masked and the texture to be too runny respectively, which hampers the quality of the dessert.

Overall, Supply and Demand is a good place to dine in. The ambience and service are both excellent, with music also being played as you are eating. However, do remember to book in advance as seats are limited at peak hours!

"Symmetry: 8.4/10

Even though I have skipped breakfast usually for lunch, I have never thought of having a brunch until recently. I decided to have my virgin brunch at Symmetry, one of the most famous places for brunch on the weekends, and it was worth it.

Symmetry Eggs Benedict ($24): 8.4/10
I thought I knew what eating for pleasure was before this. I was wrong.

This dish is pure decadence.

The star of the dish is the eggs benedict. Everything is well made. The eggs and cheese provide a richness to the dish, that is complemented with the strong earthly flavor of mushrooms. Hiding underneath these flavors is the saltiness of the bacon and the sweetness of the caramelized onions, which prevent the dish from becoming overwhelming. Texture-wise, the smoothness of the eggs is matched with the crispiness of the bacon. 

On top of that, the acidity of the salad, combined with the crispy hash browns also cuts through the rich flavor of the eggs benedict so you won’t feel the cholesterol in your veins.
I usually try to critique the flavor of a dish more, but I was grinning too much to care after the first few bites. The richness, complexity of flavors and textures, just makes this the definitive pleasure meal.

Overall, Symmetry was the best place to start my foray into brunch. On top of an insane brunch, their teas are also worth complimenting (Nymph of the Nile is fantastic) and their service is great as well. Along with the ambience, this café is the best place for friendly meetings and decadence at its finest.
